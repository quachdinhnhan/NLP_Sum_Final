<s doc_id="FT943-5106" num="10" wdcount="43"> The shortlist for the Booker, the UK's most hyped literary prize and one of the most lucrative, is all the more surprising in a bumper year for new fiction fulfilling the criteria - English language and non-American - for consideration for the award.</s>

<s doc_id="AP901008-0174" num="12" wdcount="42"> ``British publishers are very secretive about their sales but we know that when Thomas Keneally won it in 1982 for `Schindler's Ark,' his publishers, who had printed 15,000 copies, sold 75,000 over the next 23 weeks,'' said Christine Shaw of Book Trust.</s>

<s doc_id="FT943-3897" num="9" wdcount="52"> They have avoided dull and worthy classics and chosen six books which stirred the fin de siecle world and remain compelling today: George du Maurier's Trilby, Anthony Hope's The Prisoner of Zenda, George Moore's Esther Waters, Kipling's Jungle Book, George Gissing's In the Year of Jubilee and RL Stevenson's The Ebb Tide.</s>

<s doc_id="FT943-5106" num="8" wdcount="64"> The six include Alan Hollinghurst's The Folding Star (published by Chatto and Windus), a melancholy study of homosexual obsession which was tipped as a likely candidate from the initial 'long list' of 15, The Reef (Granta) by young Sri Lankan writer Romesh Gunesekera and How Late It Was, How Late (Secker and Warburg) by gritty Glasgow realist James Kelman, which was almost universally well-reviewed.</s>
<s doc_id="FT943-3897" num="19" wdcount="9"> All the books on both lists are gripping stories.</s>
<s doc_id="AP890922-0224" num="10" wdcount="32"> Ishiguro, previously nominated for the award, ``was beaten as the Booker favorite in 1986, which makes his chances that much stronger this time in our view,'' said William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe.</s>
<s doc_id="WSJ871110-0154" num="16" wdcount="24"> Last year's winner, "The Old Devils" by Kingsley Amis, was a 5-2 favorite, but this year, anyone who chose the victor made some dough.</s>

<s doc_id="FT944-16774" num="27" wdcount="12"> 'Kelman's novel is unlikely to come anywhere near that,' one bookseller said.</s>
<s doc_id="FT943-5106" num="16" wdcount="17"> 'This list,' said one man of letters, 'must have dealt a final death blow to the Booker'.</s>
<s doc_id="FT943-3897" num="28" wdcount="21"> For the great difference between then and now is that in 1894 a Booker Prize was not needed to sell fiction.</s>
