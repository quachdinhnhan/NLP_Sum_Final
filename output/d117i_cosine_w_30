<s doc_id="FT943-5106" num="6" wdcount="25"> The shortlist of six for the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction, announced yesterday, immediately prompted the question 'Who'? from many in the publishing industry.</s>

<s doc_id="FT943-5106" num="12" wdcount="26"> But if the shortlist of the final six candidates for the prize may be disappointing, the traditional controversy surrounding the award is as rife as ever.</s>
<s doc_id="FT943-3897" num="9" wdcount="52"> They have avoided dull and worthy classics and chosen six books which stirred the fin de siecle world and remain compelling today: George du Maurier's Trilby, Anthony Hope's The Prisoner of Zenda, George Moore's Esther Waters, Kipling's Jungle Book, George Gissing's In the Year of Jubilee and RL Stevenson's The Ebb Tide.</s>
<s doc_id="AP881025-0196" num="8" wdcount="24"> A panel of five judges unanimously announced the award of the $26,250 prize after an 80-minute deliberation during a banquet at London's ancient Guildhall.</s>
<s doc_id="FT943-5106" num="8" wdcount="64"> The six include Alan Hollinghurst's The Folding Star (published by Chatto and Windus), a melancholy study of homosexual obsession which was tipped as a likely candidate from the initial 'long list' of 15, The Reef (Granta) by young Sri Lankan writer Romesh Gunesekera and How Late It Was, How Late (Secker and Warburg) by gritty Glasgow realist James Kelman, which was almost universally well-reviewed.</s>
<s doc_id="FT943-3897" num="19" wdcount="9"> All the books on both lists are gripping stories.</s>
<s doc_id="AP890922-0224" num="10" wdcount="32"> Ishiguro, previously nominated for the award, ``was beaten as the Booker favorite in 1986, which makes his chances that much stronger this time in our view,'' said William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe.</s>
<s doc_id="WSJ871110-0154" num="16" wdcount="24"> Last year's winner, "The Old Devils" by Kingsley Amis, was a 5-2 favorite, but this year, anyone who chose the victor made some dough.</s>
<s doc_id="FT943-3897" num="26" wdcount="29"> Last week, a Times critic complained about the inclusion of Alan Hollinghurst's candid novel of homosexual love, The Folding Star, on the Booker list, because it offended Judaeo-Christian ethics.</s>
<s doc_id="FT944-16774" num="18" wdcount="35"> One guest at the prize-giving dinner at London's Guildhall, Mr Salman Rushdie, who won the prize in 1981 with Midnight's Children, remarked: 'James Kelman is good, but not as good as he thinks he is'.</s>
<s doc_id="FT944-16774" num="27" wdcount="12"> 'Kelman's novel is unlikely to come anywhere near that,' one bookseller said.</s>
<s doc_id="FT943-5106" num="16" wdcount="17"> 'This list,' said one man of letters, 'must have dealt a final death blow to the Booker'.</s>
<s doc_id="FT943-3897" num="28" wdcount="21"> For the great difference between then and now is that in 1894 a Booker Prize was not needed to sell fiction.</s>
<s doc_id="FT944-16774" num="7" wdcount="41"> The novel, a story of Scottish low-life narrated largely in Glaswegian dialect, is unlikely to prove a popular choice with booksellers, who have damned all six books shortlisted for the prize as boring, elitist and - worst of all - unsaleable.</s>
<s doc_id="FT943-3897" num="27" wdcount="30"> But even if Hollinghurst wins the Booker, his novel will not become the succes de scandale of Esther Waters and Trilby, which became the bestselling novel of the 19th century.</s>
<s doc_id="WSJ871110-0154" num="21" wdcount="30"> America has the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and the National Book Awards, but in terms of excitement, hoopla and man-on-the-street interest, there's nothing akin to the 15,000-pound ($26,000) Booker Prize.</s>

<s doc_id="FT923-3822" num="11" wdcount="32"> London's litterati have for weeks been betting on Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient - those of them who have seen a proof copy because it is not officially published until next week.</s>
<s doc_id="FT943-5106" num="15" wdcount="18"> But it is the final list, rather than the controversy, that discredits the award according to some critics.</s>

<s doc_id="WSJ871110-0154" num="50" wdcount="40"> The real world took notice in 1974, when Elizabeth Jane Howard, one of the three judges, wrote a letter to the Times claiming that in her opinion Kingsley Amis's "Ending Up," one of the short-listed books, was his best ever.</s>

<s doc_id="FT943-3897" num="55" wdcount="29"> Whereas the 1894 titles had contemporary settings, many of the 1994 books are historical (such as Paradise) or are driven by nostalgia (such as Beside the Ocean of Time).</s>
