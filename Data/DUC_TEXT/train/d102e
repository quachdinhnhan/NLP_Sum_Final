<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="14" wdcount="16"> Amid the blimp-size egos of the entertainment world, Lucille Ball stood out like an orange beacon.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="15" wdcount="3"> She never bragged.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="16" wdcount="6"> She never exercised her considerable power.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="17" wdcount="12"> She always seemed astonished, even embarrassed, when honors inevitably came her way.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="18" wdcount="35"> When she was to receive a humanitarian award from Variety Clubs on a CBS special five years ago, she told me: ``There comes a time in your life when you get a lot of plaques.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="19" wdcount="14"> It's very flattering and I'll go along with it, especially if it benefits children''.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="20" wdcount="26"> Whenever she was praised for ``I Love Lucy,'' she invariably replied: ``Well, all of the credit should go to (writers) Madelyn Pugh and Bob Carroll Jr''.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="21" wdcount="12"> Or, ``Desi was a genius: He was responsible for the show's success''.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="22" wdcount="10"> Or she cited co-stars Desi, Vivian Vance and Bill Frawley.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="23" wdcount="20"> Yes, the writing and producing and casting of ``I Love Lucy'' were marvelous, but Lucy's performance added the quantum force.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="24" wdcount="32"> Her inspired pantomime could be written by no one: the growing panic as the chocolate assembly line speeded up; her catalog of pained expressions after tasting the patent medicine she was demonstrating.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="25" wdcount="9"> Unlike many stars, Lucille Ball rarely indulged in self-analysis.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="26" wdcount="40"> But on one occasion she revealed why her feelings about the ``I Love Lucy'' triumph might have been ambivalent: Living through the last five years of the show, she said, ``took the edge off any enjoyment I might have had.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="27" wdcount="13"> Desi's drinking and carousing were a terrible embarrassment, bad for a woman's self-esteem.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="28" wdcount="7"> The talk around town was `poor Lucy'.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="29" wdcount="14"> Because I couldn't face people, I became a recluse for more than 5 years.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="30" wdcount="15"> ``I never demonstrated my unhappiness at the studio, and actually, working together was a blessing.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="31" wdcount="14"> Desi had everything so well organized that it was easy to do the work''.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="32" wdcount="8"> Lucy was late in reaching her comedy potential.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="33" wdcount="13"> She was 40 when ``I Love Lucy'' started on CBS and revolutionized television.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="34" wdcount="39"> And although she spent many years in Hollywood, ``none of the studios ever designed comedies for me the way MGM did for Red Skelton, Paramount did for Bob Hope and Sam Goldwyn did for Danny Kaye,'' she once said.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="35" wdcount="40"> ``Television was the medium for me, the medium for anyone who wanted to be well known a lot faster than waiting a year and a half for a movie to come out,'' she said in an interview late in life.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="36" wdcount="11"> ``Television is an instant barometer, especially the way we did it.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="37" wdcount="4"> ``It was all new.</s>

<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="41" wdcount="6"> We were all feeling our way.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="42" wdcount="23"> Desi was very innovative and very showmanship-conscious and was very intent on going ahead and doing it: `That sounds all right, let's go'!</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="43" wdcount="3"> So we went''.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="44" wdcount="6"> Always the credit to someone else.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0014" num="45" wdcount="10"> But millions upon millions of television watchers know otherwise .</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="10" wdcount="29"> As a young girl in western New York, Lucille Ball hawked hot dogs and popcorn at an amusement park as she dreamed of starring in movies, hometown friends recalled.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="11" wdcount="24"> ``She always talked about being a star,'' said Pauline Lopus, who went to school with Miss Ball and had kept in touch with her.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="12" wdcount="25"> Miss Ball, born 60 miles south of Buffalo in Jamestown on Aug. 6, 1911, grew up in nearby Celoron, a rural hamlet on Chautauqua Lake.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="13" wdcount="13"> Mrs. Lopus remembered the sitcom star on Wednesday as ``daring in many ways''.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="14" wdcount="11"> ``She tried to get me to run off (to Broadway),'' Mrs.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="15" wdcount="2"> Lopus added.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="16" wdcount="6"> ``But I didn't have the nerve''.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="17" wdcount="26"> At 15, Miss Ball worked as a barker at the amusement park, screaming for people to buy popcorn and hot dogs until she lost her voice.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="18" wdcount="28"> Later, she starred in high school plays and got her start in front of a large audience on the vaudeville stage at the defunct Palace Theater in Jamestown.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="19" wdcount="19"> Although Miss Ball hadn't visited Jamestown since 1956 and had no family there, she stayed in touch with friends.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="20" wdcount="19"> ``Even though she was a big star, she was still just Lucy to us,'' said Irene Rosseti of Celoron.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="21" wdcount="18"> Mrs. Rosseti said Miss Ball recently sent her and her husband a letter on their 50th wedding anniversary.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="22" wdcount="18"> Miss Ball regularly donated money to charities, civic events and Jamestown Community College, said Jamestown Mayor Steven Carlson.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="23" wdcount="27"> On May 20, Miss Ball was to receive an honorary degree from the college and had planned to return to Jamestown, now a city of about 40,000.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="24" wdcount="14"> Residents had put up posters saying ``Jamestown Loves Lucy'' in storefronts and home windows.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="25" wdcount="24"> After Miss Ball suffered a heart attack last week, residents decided to sign the posters and send them to her as a get-well greeting.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="26" wdcount="9"> More than 150 posters were sent with 10,000 signatures.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="27" wdcount="30"> The 77-year-old comedian died Wednesday of a ruptured aorta, the main heart artery, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where she was recovering from last week's emergency heart surgery.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="28" wdcount="18"> ``It is a sad day for all of us,'' said Nelson Garifi, an organizer of the welcoming event.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="29" wdcount="13"> ``But I'm sure that feeling is shared by many people around the world''.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="30" wdcount="16"> Garifi, community relations director for the community college, said the honorary degree will be awarded posthumously.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="31" wdcount="32"> Future generations in Celoron will have a reminder of their famous resident every time they drive or walk down the street where she grew up _ it will be renamed Lucy Lane.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="32" wdcount="18"> Village officials had planned formal ceremonies renaming the street when she was due in the area next month.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="33" wdcount="14"> ``But it will happen anyway,'' John Goodell of the village's historical society said Wednesday.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="34" wdcount="34"> When the society was formed about a year ago, Goodell said: ``We sent an invitation to Lucille Ball to be a member, and she sent back a check for $500 for a life membership.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0052" num="35" wdcount="18"> ``It was a check written in a very bold hand with a signature about a half inch high.''</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="11" wdcount="34"> An outpouring of sympathy from presidents to childhood neighbors followed the death of Lucille Ball, but many said the queen mother of comedy will live on through television reruns and her influence on comedy.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="12" wdcount="29"> The daffy, redheaded comedian whose harebrained schemes drove her television family crazy and delighted viewers for four decades died Wednesday of a ruptured abdominal artery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="13" wdcount="11"> She was 77 and died eight days after emergency heart surgery.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="14" wdcount="16"> A private burial was planned, reportedly with no funeral services in accordance with Miss Ball's wishes.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="15" wdcount="19"> ``God has her now, and, thanks to television, we'll have her forever,'' said comedian and longtime friend Bob Hope.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="16" wdcount="19"> Hospital switchboards were swamped with condolence calls and thousands of cards after Miss Ball's death, spokesman Ron Wise said.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="17" wdcount="20"> Miss Ball's family requested that any flowers sent to the Medical Center in her memory be distributed to other patients.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="18" wdcount="13"> Miss Ball maintained her sense of humor even when she was critically ill.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="19" wdcount="29"> Following her operation last week, her first words to her daughter, Lucie, were: ``Wouldn't you know _ this is the day I was going to get my hair done''.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="20" wdcount="17"> Miss Ball had been improving steadily from the heart surgery, so her death came as a shock.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="21" wdcount="8"> ``She had been walking, her spirits were up.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="22" wdcount="7"> Her family was with her,'' Wise said.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="23" wdcount="13"> ``She responded as well as anyone could respond to that kind of surgery''.</s>

<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="27" wdcount="24"> ``Probably a lot of what she did rubbed off on what I do,'' said actress-comedian Jane Curtin, star of the sitcom ``Kate and Allie''.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="28" wdcount="10"> ``But it couldn't be helped, because I memorized her shows''.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="29" wdcount="24"> The show, one of the most popular in television history, was distinguished by Miss Ball's faultless timing, rubber-faced expressions, wide-mouthed wails and extravagant pratfalls.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="30" wdcount="16"> ``Working with Lucy was like receiving an M.A. or a Ph.D. in comedy,'' recalled Joan Rivers.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="31" wdcount="20"> ``What she forgot about comic timing and delivery is more than most of us will ever learn in a lifetime''.</s>

<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="33" wdcount="14"> She showed us human foibles and gave us a chance to laugh at ourselves''.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="34" wdcount="28"> Miss Goldberg said her favorite episode involved a visit by the ``I Love Lucy'' characters to Hollywood, where Lucy and Ethel spotted actor William Holden in a restaurant.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="35" wdcount="18"> ``That was how we would all react to seeing a movie star in a restaurant,'' Miss Goldberg said.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="36" wdcount="16"> ``She was looking at him in a compact mirror, and trying to look at him surreptitiously.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="37" wdcount="12"> And that's just an example of how everyone can identify with Lucy''.</s>
<s docid="AP890427-0098" num="38" wdcount="47"> Bob Rosati, who lives down the street from the Beverly Hills home Miss Ball shared with husband Gary Morton, said he was watching a rerun of ``I Love Lucy'' on Wednesday morning when the screen went black and the words ``In Memory of Lucille Ball, 1911-1989'' appeared.</s>

<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="9" wdcount="32"> Lucille Ball, whose death Wednesday morning at the age of 77 will be the most widely and deeply felt show-business loss in recent memory, was the movies' greatest gift to television .</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="10" wdcount="34"> It turned out to be one of Sam Goldwyn's finest and most prophetic hours when he signed her as one of his Goldwyn Girls to appear in "Roman Scandals" with Eddie Cantor in 1933.</s>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="11" wdcount="30"> She had had bit parts in two earlier films but "Roman Scandals" was the one that gave her a firmer foothold on the slippery slopes of a Hollywood career .</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="12" wdcount="6"> The movies prepared her for television.</s>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="13" wdcount="26"> She perfected her matchless craft as a comedienne in dozens of films, including three of Fred Astaire's and one of the Marx Brothers ("Room Service") .</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="14" wdcount="16"> A lot of the other films caused few ripples on the wide surface of film history.</s>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="15" wdcount="40"> But in those years Lucy was refining her enduring, endearing public image as a perky, saucy woman who was likelier (at least in the early days) to end up with the hero's funny pal than with the hero himself .</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="16" wdcount="35"> Yet as often happened with supporting performers, her verve, an engagingly sharp tongue and a rather salty view of the world made her more interesting than the square-cut principals, and led to leading roles .</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="17" wdcount="23"> To look at the "I Love Lucy" reruns today, as everybody does, again and again, is to realize how superbly professional they are.</s>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="18" wdcount="19"> Today many sitcoms still use the three-camera technique, shooting in front of live audiences, that Desi Arnaz pioneered .</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="19" wdcount="43"> The idea now seems as inevitable as the wheel or pre-sliced muffins, and yet you wonder if it would have worked nearly as well or caught on at all without Lucy's sheer expertise as a physical as well as a verbal comedienne .</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="20" wdcount="33"> She made it all -- even the wildest, craziest capers -- look as if it were happening now -- spontaneous, unrehearsed, accidental, the inevitable consequences of the screen Lucy's scatterbrained and lovable personality.</s>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="21" wdcount="26"> Her foils -- Desi himself, Vivian Vance and William Frawley -- were superb farceurs themselves, but Lucy was the dynamo that made it all work .</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="22" wdcount="12"> The craft was invisible, the skills so perfected they concealed themselves totally.</s>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="23" wdcount="25"> It was a brilliant illusion, generating a charm that hid the hard work and the artful writing and editing as well as the performing .</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="24" wdcount="18"> The result was probably the finest and certainly the most durable single series in television's history thus far.</s>

</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="26" wdcount="13"> They were wholly, prototypically American, and that is central to their popularity abroad.</s>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="27" wdcount="22"> Yet they have been embraced as the kind of middle-class goings-on that might possibly arise almost anywhere there is a middle class.</s>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="28" wdcount="11"> Lucy was all-American but, equally, a citizen of the world .</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="29" wdcount="26"> Her successful career in films, in which she ultimately earned star billing if not superstar status, gave her an invaluable identification when "I Love Lucy" began.</s>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="30" wdcount="28"> The irony is that, created by the movies, she was to achieve fame and fortune in television on a scale that had eluded her in the movies .</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="31" wdcount="38"> Indeed, when Lucy began to commandeer our hearts on "I Love Lucy" in 1951, the movies were already in considerable trouble, their audiences staying home in large numbers to watch the likes of Lucy in their living rooms.</s>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="32" wdcount="7"> As always, her timing was impeccable .</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="33" wdcount="7"> Lucille Ball was not Lucy, of course.</s>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="34" wdcount="23"> She had come a hard road from Jamestown, N.Y., in a line of work in which you did not survive by being scatterbrained.</s>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="35" wdcount="19"> She was smart, hard-working and a perfectionist who knew that whatever else it was, comedy was not accidental .</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA042789-0068" num="36" wdcount="45"> Then again, the cameras, television or film, have X-ray properties, and the millions who saw and loved her were not wrong to think they perceived a generous and loving woman, as well as a glorious clown who knew the world was better off laughing .</s>
