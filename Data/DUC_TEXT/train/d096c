<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="13" wdcount="30"> This year, Carley is the co-chairman of one of the featured events of Super Bowl week, the Bambaleo Parade, a Saturday extravaganza with marching bands, a street festival and floats.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="14" wdcount="16"> The grand marshal of the parade will be Lee Roy Selmon, a former Tampa Bay Buccaneer.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="15" wdcount="16"> Other events will include a salute to black sports legends and a Doug Williams golf tournament.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="16" wdcount="31"> 'Much more involvement'; This year, the Super Bowl Task Force, a group headed by two of the city's most influential white businessmen, named two black men to head a community-relations committee.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="17" wdcount="19"> But perhaps most important, Carley said, several minority-owned businesses have won lucrative contracts from the NFL for the game.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="18" wdcount="20"> "There's much more involvement this time, black and white," said Carley, who is the affirmative-action officer for Hillsboro Community College.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="19" wdcount="5"> "There's been a heightened awareness.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="20" wdcount="42"> In 1984, there was not even a thought given to a black man."; About 100,000 visitors, many of them corporate and political movers and shakers, were expected to arrive in Tampa this week for the festivities leading up to the game Sunday.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="21" wdcount="34"> The game itself, which is televised to 750 million people around the world, is only part of an event whose impact on a city has been compared to that of a national political convention.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="22" wdcount="21"> Hotels, restaurants and other businesses are anticipating an estimated $125 million in revenues, with a total economic impact of $200 million.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="23" wdcount="27"> 'It's a bay window'; "The Super Bowl introduces you to the world in a big way," said Barbara Casey, the coordinator of the Super Bowl Task Force.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="24" wdcount="29"> "You don't have to say Tampa, Fla., anymore."; The Super Bowl also can highlight a community's problems, and bring the frustrations of many of its members to the surface.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="26" wdcount="40"> "It's a bay window."; Last month, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said he would stand by his recommendation to move the 1993 Super Bowl out of Tempe, Ariz., because the state does not have a holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="27" wdcount="44"> A week before the Super Bowl in Miami two years ago, the fatal shooting of a black man on a motorcycle by an Hispanic police officer in the predominantly black Overtown neighborhood set off three days of looting and torchings of buildings and cars.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="28" wdcount="31"> While the disturbances were not caused by the Super Bowl, the NFL was criticized at the time for not making enough of an effort to include minority-group members in the festivities.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="29" wdcount="13"> "I think Miami was the awakening for a lot of people," Carley said.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="30" wdcount="44"> In Tampa, Super Bowl XXV brought about the cancellation of what was the biggest annual event in the city for 86 years: the Gasparilla Parade, an extravaganza that featured 500 of the city's most powerful men swaggering through the streets dressed as gun-toting pirates.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="31" wdcount="16"> Tampa officials made the parade part of their pitch to the NFL for the Super Bowl.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="32" wdcount="34"> But after Tampa was awarded the 1991 Super Bowl, a racial dispute erupted over the parade, which always has been sponsored and organized by an all-white, all-male private club, Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="33" wdcount="21"> The club's top officials refused the demands of a coalition of black residents, including Carley, that the club be integrated immediately.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="34" wdcount="5"> Instead, they canceled the parade.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="35" wdcount="22"> The Super Bowl Task Force had to scramble to put together a new parade, and Carley became the co-chairman of that effort.</s>

<s docid="WSJ870122-0100" num="7" wdcount="19"> Sports Illustrated is taking 300 advertisers to Super Bowl XXI in Pasadena, Calif., this weekend for an all-out bash.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870122-0100" num="8" wdcount="32"> Along with getting seats for Sunday's game, the guests will brunch at the chic Spago restaurant, take a private tour of Universal Studios and attend a wing-ding at the Century Plaza Hotel.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870122-0100" num="9" wdcount="23"> The magazine is just one of hundreds of businesses whose officials and customers will be among the 104,000 fans attending the Super Bowl.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870122-0100" num="10" wdcount="28"> And the companies show few signs of cutting back on their activities despite the new tax law's tighter restrictions on what can be claimed as a business-entertainment expense.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870122-0100" num="11" wdcount="46"> Still, the new rules do change things for a variety of Super Bowl entertaining -- from an executive sitting in a $1,500 seat on the 50-yard line to a businessman holding a Super Bowl party in his living room and hoping to write off the costs.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870122-0100" num="12" wdcount="31"> One big change under the new law limits business-entertainment deductions for tickets to sporting events like the Super Bowl: Only 80% of the face value of such tickets can be deducted.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870122-0100" num="13" wdcount="28"> If a company purchases a a 50-yard-line seat for $1,500 -- the going rate -- it can deduct only 80% of the ticket's $75 face value, or $60.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870122-0100" num="14" wdcount="34"> Even to get the 80% deduction, there still must be a "substantial and bona fide business discussion" before, during or after the game, says Julian Block, a tax specialist at Prentice-Hall Information Services Inc.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870122-0100" num="15" wdcount="19"> To take a client to a game as merely a good-will gesture is no longer enough, Mr. Block says.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870122-0100" num="16" wdcount="26"> And if a company wants to simply give clients tickets to the game, the business gift carries a total deduction of only $25 for each recipient.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870122-0100" num="17" wdcount="16"> The tougher IRS rule, however, hasn't slowed ticket demand; even end-zone seats are fetching $500 each.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870122-0100" num="18" wdcount="35"> "Even if it weren't tax deductible, it'd be worth it," says Tom Foley, chairman of Bibb Co., a Macon, Ga., maker of home furnishings and textile products that use the National Football League team logos.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870122-0100" num="19" wdcount="13"> Bibb is flying about 20 people -- mostly customers -- to the game.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870122-0100" num="20" wdcount="13"> "We get more earnings from the trip than the expense," says Mr. Foley.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870122-0100" num="21" wdcount="17"> Some companies say they are making adjustments or at least educating their executives about the new rules.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870122-0100" num="22" wdcount="31"> A spokesman for Adolph Coors & Co, the Golden, Colo., brewery, said its tax advisers instructed executives that "this can't be just a fun trip -- we have to discuss business".</s>
<s docid="WSJ870122-0100" num="23" wdcount="22"> Air fare and lodging are still 100% deductible, as long as there is a planned business meeting in addition to the game.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870122-0100" num="24" wdcount="11"> Meals are now 80% deductible as long as business is discussed.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870122-0100" num="25" wdcount="23"> Under the old law, meals were fully deductible and all a company had to do was show a business relationship with the guest.</s>
