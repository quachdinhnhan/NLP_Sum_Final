<s docid="SJMN91-06234048" num="13" wdcount="17"> The camera zooms in on the impassive faces of the two men last seen in Gorbachev's office.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06234048" num="14" wdcount="5"> What is going on here?</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06234048" num="15" wdcount="12"> OK, it's a hackneyed device that would only work in the movies.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06234048" num="16" wdcount="17"> But then, this week's events in the Soviet Union have all the makings of a spy thriller.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06234048" num="17" wdcount="42"> Kremlinologists who dabble in conspiracy theories are working overtime, though they insist that their darkest imaginings be clearly labeled "pure speculation."; "Once you have a palace coup, the possibilities are endless," said Robert Conquest, a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06234048" num="18" wdcount="34"> "Russian politics are full of very strange things."; For all we know, Conquest joked, Gorbachev could be injected with drugs to change his personality or KGB scientists could produce a body-double to impersonate him.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06234048" num="19" wdcount="9"> "His friends would know, but would you or I"?</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06234048" num="20" wdcount="2"> Conquest said.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06234048" num="21" wdcount="27"> "That would be going a bit far."; A more intriguing scenario has Gorbachev conspiring with the coup plotters to engineer a transformation of the Soviet political landscape.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06234048" num="22" wdcount="37"> The thinking goes like this:; With his popularity at rock bottom, Gorbachev, a lifelong creature of the KGB, hatches a false coup in order to step out of the way while hard-liners and liberals battle each other.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06234048" num="23" wdcount="17"> The coup falls apart and Gorbachev triumphantly returns with a level of legitimacy he never enjoyed before.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06234048" num="24" wdcount="30"> The theory could explain the apparent bungling of the coup plotters, said author Joseph Finder, whose 1991 novel, "The Moscow Club," foreshadowed many of the elements of the current crisis.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06234048" num="25" wdcount="26"> Finder, who said he did not subscribe to the scenario, nonetheless pointed out that tanks did not begin to roll until hours after Gorbachev's supposed arrest.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06234048" num="26" wdcount="12"> Russian President Boris Yeltsin was not arrested, and Leningrad was left alone.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06234048" num="27" wdcount="11"> Speculation was not unique to Kremlin watchers in the United States.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06234048" num="28" wdcount="40"> Theorizing was rampant in the streets of Moscow on Tuesday, said San Francisco businesswoman Kimberly Getto, who sent a long fax detailing speculation, fueled by the fact that many of the tanks encircling the Russian parliament building had no ammunition.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06234048" num="29" wdcount="9"> Gorbachev did not want bloodshed, according to the theory.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06234048" num="30" wdcount="22"> The Democratic Reform Movement, headed by former Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, Gorbachev's longtime ally, floated the same possibility in a statement Monday.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06234048" num="31" wdcount="36"> "It's highly implausible, but not to be excluded, that Gorbachev himself agreed to a withdrawal, thinking he'd show them they still needed him," said Norman Naimark, director of Stanford's Center for Russian and East European Studies.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06234048" num="32" wdcount="9"> "The degree of connivance is difficult to gauge" .</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="15" wdcount="32"> But the people of the Soviet Union apparently concluded that the real issue was not Gorbachev himself, but the new political culture of freedom and even democracy that his reforms had created.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="16" wdcount="18"> For the first time in their thousand-year history, Russians asserted their independence from autocracy, and the autocrats fell.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="17" wdcount="11"> There will be much to sort out in the months ahead.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="18" wdcount="17"> But almost certainly the failure of the counterrevolution will accelerate the democratic revolution it tried to choke.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="19" wdcount="21"> That revolution will alter the country, creating a new, decentralized and probably smaller Soviet Union much more quickly than anyone anticipated.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="20" wdcount="10"> Gorbachev's own standing also will be transformed by these events.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="21" wdcount="33"> It seems unlikely that he can escape the consequences of his own past miscalculations -- especially the miscalculation that led him to embrace the very men who led this putsch against his rule.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="22" wdcount="35"> Gorbachev was the most resourceful and creative political leader of the late 20th century, but this week he was trumped by Boris Yeltsin, who will now rightly be seen as the man who saved him.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="23" wdcount="7"> Yeltsin had two talents that Gorbachev lacked.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="24" wdcount="39"> One was the ability to stay close to the Russian people as their world was transformed by Gorbachev's revolution -- hence his thumping victory in this spring's first presidential election in Russia and Gorbachev's abysmal standing in the polls.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="25" wdcount="24"> Yeltsin's second talent was his eagerness to challenge the apparatus of the Soviet Communist Party, the world from which both he and Gorbachev emerged.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="26" wdcount="8"> Gorbachev could never shuck his party apparatchik's skin.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="27" wdcount="31"> Instead of reaching out to new ideas and new people as Yeltsin has, he surrounded himself with traditional Communist Party officials and worried about the impact of new schemes and ideas.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="28" wdcount="45"> Gorbachev thought Vladimir Kryuchkov of the KGB, Boris Pugo of the Ministry of Interior, Dmitri Yazov of the Red Army and Gennady Yanayev of the Communist Party were necessary bedfellows whose presence in his entourage could protect him from conservative forces that hated his reforms.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="29" wdcount="8"> Instead, they turned out to be mortal enemies.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="30" wdcount="14"> If they had been only personal enemies, Gorbachev might have been undone by them.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="31" wdcount="51"> But when they closed the new, liberal news media and reverted to the Stalinist tradition of the big lie, the members of the State Emergency Committee threatened not just Gorbachev but also the new Soviet Union -- a society that offered its citizens an unprecedented opportunity for dignity, self-reliance and freedom.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="32" wdcount="19"> For years, Soviets and Western Kremlinologists had debated whether the changes that created this new Soviet Union were irreversible.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="33" wdcount="7"> Tuesday, it became clear that they were.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="34" wdcount="13"> Of course, Gorbachev initiated those changes, and history will credit him for that.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="35" wdcount="23"> He also refused to acquiesce to the state of emergency that those responsible for the coup apparently asked him to endorse last weekend.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="36" wdcount="40"> It is intriguing in assessing the coup's failure that men trained as thugs by some of the most violent and mean-spirited institutions created by any state could not, in their moment of truth, behave like thugs and kill their compatriots.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="37" wdcount="34"> They left Gorbachev alive and Yeltsin at large; they let the Western media report their coup as it unfolded; and they allowed foreign radio stations to broadcast news of it back into the country.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="38" wdcount="20"> Even their own news media, under strict control, conveyed the fact that there was widespread resistance to their attempted coup.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="39" wdcount="22"> By Tuesday night, the Emergency Committee was in a confrontation with the political legitimacy of Yeltsin, and this proved an unequal contest.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="40" wdcount="40"> As Gorbachev had previously discovered in his negotiations with Yeltsin over a new union treaty, the legitimacy provided by the 50 million votes that Yeltsin received in the elections for president of the Russian federation was a formidable political force.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="41" wdcount="22"> At first blush, the botching of the coup was surprising -- couldn't the vaunted KGB and its allies run an efficient putsch?</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="42" wdcount="20"> But these were representatives of the political class that turned one of the world's richest nations into a basket case.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="43" wdcount="37"> Perhaps their coup should be seen as a desperate and forlorn effort to deny a truth that proved undeniable -- that the Stalinist system had failed so utterly there was simply no way to redeem it .</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="34" wdcount="22"> Yeltsin also seemed eager to impress on Gorbachev just how thoroughly he had been betrayed by his own ministers and presumed allies.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="35" wdcount="50"> He handed Gorbachev the minutes of a closed Council of Ministers meeting held last Monday during which all of the more than 20 ministers present -- with one or two exceptions -- supported the coup and the State Committee for the State of Emergency set up by the putsch leaders.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="36" wdcount="15"> "I haven't read this yet," said Gorbachev in an attempt to put off the matter.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="37" wdcount="4"> "Go ahead," Yeltsin insisted.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="38" wdcount="32"> "Read it now."; And Gorbachev did, reeling off the names of all of the ministers who had for so long mouthed the slogans of reform and then stabbed him in the back.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="39" wdcount="17"> "This whole government has got to resign," Gorbachev said with a degree of despair in his voice.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="40" wdcount="31"> "I must say this has been a great drama for me, a severe trial."; Retribution for Yeltsin; Yeltsin seemed to take extraordinary relish in this Shakespearean drama of betrayal and retribution.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="41" wdcount="25"> It had been Gorbachev who ordered Yeltsin out of a hospital bed in 1987 to face a vengeful meeting of the Moscow Communist Party Committee.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="42" wdcount="24"> At that session, one speaker after another attacked Yeltsin for "political immaturity" and other sins for daring to criticize the party and its Politburo.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="43" wdcount="23"> And it was Gorbachev in 1990 who came to the Russian parliament to call on deputies to vote against Yeltsin as their chairman.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="44" wdcount="49"> Although this seemingly endless political saga of two reformers who can only struggle to find a common language seemed at an end this spring when they began negotiations on a new Union Treaty, it is clear that their relationship will likely remain the great floating opera of Soviet politics.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="45" wdcount="16"> Gorbachev said he and Yeltsin had also agreed to assume each other's duties in an emergency.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="46" wdcount="30"> "If one or another gets in the situation when he cannot even give orders, like what happened now, his rights and responsibilities are automatically taken by the other," Gorbachev said.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="47" wdcount="19"> It appeared that the move would have to be temporary and could be made permanent only with legislative consent.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="48" wdcount="8"> Soviet law makes the vice president the next-in-line.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="49" wdcount="13"> Gennady Yanayev invoked that law in the coup while declaring Gorbachev physically incapacitated.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="50" wdcount="10"> The conspirators themselves are now in jail and facing interrogation.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="51" wdcount="44"> Gorbachev said the leaders of the junta "tried to turn us all into chopped meat" and they should be prosecuted without "hesitation or forgiveness."; Soviet Prime Minister Valetin Pavlov has been arrested for helping to lead the coup, Soviet and Russian television reported today.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="52" wdcount="28"> Pavlov was one of the eight officials in the committee that ousted Gorbachev from power, but he was reportedly taken ill on Sunday night when the coup began.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="53" wdcount="14"> He has been under police guard in a hospital since Gorbachev regained power Wednesday.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="54" wdcount="14"> Speculation of guilt also turned on another key figure in the old Gorbachev government.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="55" wdcount="24"> According to Yeltsin, Supreme Soviet Chairman Anatoly Lukyanov has been ousted for taking part in the coup, but that has not been confirmed .</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06238185" num="12" wdcount="13"> Gorbachev chose to ignore warnings about the right's impending attempt to seize power.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06238185" num="13" wdcount="15"> Some warnings came from Gorbachev's liberal advisers, such as Alexander Yakovlev, shortly before the coup.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06238185" num="14" wdcount="10"> But, incredibly, the clearest signals came from the hard-liners themselves.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06238185" num="15" wdcount="43"> A leading conservative journalist, Alexander Prokhanov, known as the "nightingale of the General Staff," published a transcript of his conversation with the head of the General Staff Academy, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet Navy and Gorbachev's deputy at the Defense Council, Oleg Baklanov.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06238185" num="16" wdcount="26"> With remarkable candor, Baklanov called for a military takeover as an appropriate step to avert reforms that would result in a fundamental transformation of the union.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06238185" num="17" wdcount="14"> Needless to say, Baklanov delivered on that warning and joined the Gang of Eight.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06238185" num="18" wdcount="4"> Gorbachev ignored these warnings.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06238185" num="19" wdcount="28"> To some -- an admitted minority -- the thought of a Gorbachev conspiracy is comfortably within the range of the traditional Soviet art of deception known as maskirovka.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06238185" num="20" wdcount="26"> And to laymen, something that odd could make sense in a country where illness can mean anything from the flu to a precipitous fall from power.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06238185" num="21" wdcount="31"> The most volatile fuel for the conspiracy theory came directly from Gorbachev himself, in his Thursday news conference in which he described his three days under house arrest in the Crimea.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06238185" num="22" wdcount="29"> Among the questions: If Gorbachev's 32 armed guards remained loyal to him throughout, why was there no conflict with the opposition delegation that notified the president of the coup?</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06238185" num="23" wdcount="15"> Why didn't the coup leaders incapacitate Gorbachev's guards, or at least separate them from him?</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06238185" num="24" wdcount="40"> If Gorbachev's contact with the outside world was limited to intercepting Western radio outlets on an ancient shortwave radio, how was he able to describe the news conference given by the collaborators, down to his view of their trembling hands?</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06238185" num="25" wdcount="28"> It is highly unlikely that the hard-liners had been set up or ordered by Gorbachev to launch a hopeless coup attempt in order to improve his political standing.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06238185" num="26" wdcount="16"> Such a scenario would require an unprecedented degree of selfless commitment to Gorbachev on their part.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06238185" num="27" wdcount="60"> A more plausible scenario is that Gorbachev was initially a full member of the conspiracy, which, with his participation, could have clung to the fig leaf of constitutionality and would have thwarted the new Union Treaty, to have been signed last Tuesday, which provided for transfer of key levers of power from the federal presidency to the leaders of republics.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06238185" num="28" wdcount="42"> It is possible that, unwilling to take a huge risk and openly side with the hard-liners at the start of the coup, Gorbachev had decided to become ill and wait out the initial phase under virtually self-imposed confinement in his summer residence.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06238185" num="29" wdcount="19"> Gorbachev did reveal, however, that two important officials had visited him in Crimea at the outset of the coup.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06238185" num="30" wdcount="34"> One was head of the KGB department responsible for the security of Soviet leaders; the other was V. Boldin, Gorbachev's closest aide, by the president's own admission a man of absolute loyalty to him.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06238185" num="31" wdcount="43"> One can't help but wonder whether these two visitors came to deliver an ultimatum to Gorbachev and put him under arrest in the event of his non-compliance, or to deliver important documents from fellow junta members at the outset of their joint enterprise.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06238185" num="32" wdcount="36"> Conspiracy theorists grope for motives -- Gorbachev wanted to ferret out disloyal elements in his government, to make himself a hero and to delay the scheduled signing of a treaty that would have lessened his powers.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06238185" num="33" wdcount="9"> But there is virtually unanimous agreement on one point.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06238185" num="34" wdcount="23"> Gorbachev put into power the very hard-liners who fronted the coup and kept them in power despite their vocal mutterings about him .</s>
