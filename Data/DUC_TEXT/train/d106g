<s docid="SJMN91-06145218" num="15" wdcount="17"> He has spent his moral capital trying, unsuccessfully, to end the murderous conflict between black political factions.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06145218" num="19" wdcount="5"> But events have caught up.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06145218" num="20" wdcount="26"> The radicals in the ANC may well use the trial and conviction of Mrs. Mandela to arouse members against Nelson Mandela's policy of peace and negotiation.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06145218" num="21" wdcount="30"> There are rumors that at a national conference next month the radicals will try to move such older leaders as Mandela and Walter Sisulu aside to a nominal senior role.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06145218" num="22" wdcount="25"> It is a gloomy picture: an elderly man bearing the hopes of peace in South Africa beset by problems, personal trauma on top of political.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06145218" num="29" wdcount="18"> The ANC issued a detached statement saying that the last word had not been spoken in the case.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06145218" num="33" wdcount="6"> The next step is formal negotiations.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06145218" num="34" wdcount="35"> They can come only when the government takes further steps to meet the reasonable ANC demand for action against violence -- in particular, a ban on the carrying of so-called "cultural" weapons such as spears.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06145218" num="35" wdcount="16"> How can the government look away when 1,000 Zulus carrying spears and machetes slaughter township residents?</s>
