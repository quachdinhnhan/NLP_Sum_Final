<s docid="AP900117-0193" num="10" wdcount="34"> Superior Court Judge William Pounders received a note from the jurors as they ended their day's deliberation and called a hearing for Thursday to discuss the deadlock and possibly opening the 52 sealed verdicts.</s>
<s docid="AP900117-0193" num="11" wdcount="39"> In an interview Wednesday evening, Pounders said he would deal with the deadlocked counts first, either declaring a mistrial on those counts and reading the sealed verdicts, or sending the jury back to resume deliberations on the undecided counts.</s>
<s docid="AP900117-0193" num="12" wdcount="13"> He said the verdicts could also be read before sending the jury back.</s>

<s docid="AP900117-0193" num="21" wdcount="18"> One of the charges which apparently has divided the jurors is the conspiracy charge which names both defendants.</s>
<s docid="AP900117-0193" num="22" wdcount="31"> Jurors asked twice for an explanation of how they could convict one defendant and acquit the other on that joint charge, but seemed perplexed after they received an explanation earlier Wednesday.</s>
<s docid="AP900117-0193" num="23" wdcount="31"> After conferring with lawyers, Pounders told jurors they could convict just one of the defendants on the charge ``if you feel that the defendant conspired with one or more other persons''.</s>
<s docid="AP900117-0193" num="24" wdcount="18"> However, he noted the conspiracy count includes eight alleged overt acts, some of them naming only one defendant.</s>
<s docid="AP900117-0193" num="25" wdcount="19"> A split verdict, he said, would require elimination of overt acts alleged against a defendant acquitted of the charge.</s>

<s docid="AP900118-0183" num="35" wdcount="37"> Raymond Buckey spent nearly five years in jail without bail during the case, which defense attorneys said was the result of community hysteria sparked by bizarre allegations by the alcoholic mother of one child at the preschool.</s>
<s docid="AP900118-0183" num="36" wdcount="31"> Some observers accused then-District Attorney Robert Philibosian of using the spectacular charges to boost his failing re-election campaign against Ira Reiner, who beat him and now runs the district attorney's office.</s>
