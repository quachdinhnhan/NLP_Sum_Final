</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA070289-0167" num="16" wdcount="30"> Even as he spoke, Soviet officials reported new violence in the south -- this time between Georgians and Azerbaijanis inside the Georgian republic but in an area with many Azerbaijanis.</s>

<P>
<s docid="LA070289-0167" num="18" wdcount="45"> Although limited so far in scope, some of the ethnic conflicts could grow to the point where various regions of the country would be thrown into virtual civil war, Gorbachev suggested, and some national republics could find themselves in violent disputes with their neighbors .</s>

<P>
<s docid="LA070289-0167" num="23" wdcount="60"> The ethnic strife, much of it rooted in past Soviet policies of domination by ethnic Russians or in the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of people during the Stalinist era, has increasingly drained the political energy necessary to push through major reforms and has provided conservative critics of reform with a potent argument against faster and broader change .</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA070289-0167" num="24" wdcount="45"> For Gorbachev, the spread of the unrest has forced the humiliating admission that the Soviet Union, a superpower in world terms, cannot ensure the domestic tranquility that is a first priority for any government -- nor can it protect its own minorities against pogroms .</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA070289-0167" num="25" wdcount="30"> If the strife here continued and grew, he asked, "What kind of example shall we set for others while calling on the whole of mankind to build a nonviolent world"?</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA070289-0167" num="26" wdcount="41"> Of equal gravity for Gorbachev in domestic political terms has been the growth of not only nationalism but the appearance of secessionist groups in the Baltic republics and in Armenia, Georgia and Moldavia, a Soviet republic on the Romanian border .</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA070289-0167" num="27" wdcount="33"> The whole issue is believed to have been the subject of a high-level Communist Party conference here late last week, and Gorbachev's unusual television address underscores the threat posed by the conflicts .</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA070289-0167" num="28" wdcount="38"> Gorbachev acknowledged that ethnic relations are "wound in a tight knot of contradictions" because of previous Soviet policies, particularly the effort to pull the country's 100-plus ethnic groups into a new "Soviet nationality" with a unified culture .</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA070289-0167" num="29" wdcount="22"> This policy had, in fact, collided head on with growing ethnic awareness throughout the country and made the problems even worse .</s>

<P>
<s docid="LA070289-0167" num="30" wdcount="27"> Past economic policies, including the "stagnation" in many regions under the regime of the late President Leonid I. Brezhnev, had also made the problems more acute .</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA070289-0167" num="31" wdcount="49"> "We are also reaping today the results of lawlessness in preceding decades -- the deportation of whole peoples from their lands and the burying in oblivion of the national interests of small ethnic groups," Gorbachev said, alluding to actions carried out decades ago by the dictator Josef Stalin .</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA070289-0167" num="32" wdcount="52"> "Such excesses resulted in indifference to ethnic interests, to many outstanding social and economic problems in constituent republics and autonomous regions, deformities in the development of the languages and cultures of the country's different peoples, the deteriorating demographic situation and many other negative consequences that ultimately provoked tension in inter-ethnic relations" .</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA070289-0167" num="33" wdcount="61"> Although these questions will be dealt with during a special meeting of the Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee in late July and then debated again by the Congress of People's Deputies, the country's new national assembly, Gorbachev apparently felt that he could not wait for those debates, and he set out his own broad guidelines for dealing with the crisis .</s>

</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA070289-0167" num="36" wdcount="44"> The refusal to recognize the basic principle of equality had led to attacks on minority groups in several parts of the country, Gorbachev said, alluding to the particularly vicious assaults on Mesketian Turks in Uzbekistan last month in which about 100 people died .</s>
