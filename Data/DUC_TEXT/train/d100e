<s docid="AP880808-0040" num="8" wdcount="39"> An excerpt from the book, ``The Lives of John Lennon'' by journalist and biographer Albert Goldman, appearing in the Aug. 15 issue of People magazine, discloses a sometimes unflattering portrait of both Lennon and his second wife, Yoko Ono.</s>
<s docid="AP880808-0040" num="9" wdcount="16"> The book is scheduled to be published later this month by William Morrow & Co. Inc.</s>
<s docid="AP880808-0040" num="10" wdcount="12"> Between 1976 and 1979, Goldman writes, Lennon ``could not be more remote''.</s>
<s docid="AP880808-0040" num="11" wdcount="27"> Apart from a few hours in the morning and evening, including time spent with his son, Sean, ``Lennon is back here in his room, alone and silent''.</s>
<s docid="AP880808-0040" num="12" wdcount="23"> The author says the idolized Beatle spent most of his adult life as an anorexic, starving himself to what he perceived as perfection.</s>
<s docid="AP880808-0040" num="13" wdcount="24"> The onset of the eating disorder can be traced to 1965, Goldman writes, ``when some fool described him in print as the `fat Beatle'.</s>
<s docid="AP880808-0040" num="14" wdcount="17"> '' ``That phrase struck such a blow to his fragile ego that the wound has never healed''.</s>
<s docid="AP880808-0040" num="15" wdcount="19"> Lennon rarely wore clothing, other than a pair of backless slippers, and avoided touching anyone, according to the book.</s>
<s docid="AP880808-0040" num="16" wdcount="12"> The 719-page biography also details Yoko Ono's $5,000-a-week heroin habit in 1979.</s>
<s docid="AP880808-0040" num="17" wdcount="5"> She reportedly snorted the drug.</s>
<s docid="AP880808-0040" num="18" wdcount="15"> According to the book, Lennon also took heroin and consumed a great deal of LSD.</s>
<s docid="AP880808-0040" num="19" wdcount="13"> ``I must have taken a thousand trips,'' the book quotes Lennon as saying.</s>
<s docid="AP880808-0040" num="20" wdcount="9"> ``I just ate it all the time like candy''.</s>
<s docid="AP880808-0040" num="21" wdcount="27"> Goldman spent more than six years researching the book, interviewing 1,200 friends, relatives and associates of Lennon, who was murdered eight years ago in New York .</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="9" wdcount="32"> A biography that portrays John Lennon as a drug-addled, anorexic bisexual who raged his way from Liverpool to New York City is ``totally fiction,'' Yoko Ono said in a national radio broadcast.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="10" wdcount="9"> ``It's amazing that somebody took such a poetic license.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="11" wdcount="7"> I don't see John in there ...</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="12" wdcount="26"> It's a very dramatically described something, but it's not about John,'' Ono said Wednesday night in her first broadcast comments on the book by Albert Goldman.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="13" wdcount="31"> The usually reclusive Ono agreed to the interview to counter Goldman's ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' which presents the ex-Beatle as a violent, drug-addicted drunk who wanted to dump his wife.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="14" wdcount="19"> As for Ono, Goldman shows her as a gold-digger who snorted heroin up to the time of Lennon's death.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="15" wdcount="30"> Goldman also charges she was responsible for Paul McCartney's 1980 marijuana bust in Japan, had affairs while they were married and was just as intent on a divorce as Lennon.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="16" wdcount="27"> Ono refuted virtually all of these charges, and countered through taped interviews with Lennon friends and employees that Goldman's book was based on unreliable sources and misquotes.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="17" wdcount="25"> ``It's totally fiction,'' Yoko said during the hour-long program, which opened with Lennon's song, ``Gimme Some Truth,'' and coincided with the book's national release Wednesday.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="18" wdcount="8"> ``These people in this book are not us.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="19" wdcount="7"> It's not John and me,'' Ono continued.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="20" wdcount="9"> ``It's unfair he's been assaulted and can't hit back.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="21" wdcount="23"> ... For some reason this book is attempting to rob both John and I of the basic human dignity that we're entitled to''.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="22" wdcount="23"> The Ono interview was taped Aug. 28 at the Dakota, where the Lennons lived _ and Yoko still lives with their son, Sean.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="23" wdcount="14"> Lennon was murdered by Mark David Chapman outside the Dakota on Dec. 8, 1980.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="24" wdcount="28"> The interview was broadcast nationwide via the Westwood One Network; spokeswoman Laurie Wilde said an exact figure on how many stations picked up the broadcast was not available.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="25" wdcount="9"> Also appearing were Sean and Lennon other son, Julian.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="26" wdcount="27"> Ono was interviewed by longtime associate Elliot Mintz, who is described in Goldman's book as a spy for Yoko _ a charge Mintz denied during the show.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="27" wdcount="15"> ``It is, for one, very upsetting, but most of all it is lies, untruths ...</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="28" wdcount="19"> The whole thing is just sickening,'' said Julian, who also refuted Goldman's tales of Lennon as a violent father.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="29" wdcount="17"> Mintz read excerpts from the book to Yoko, who then responded to the allegations point by point.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="30" wdcount="31"> She denied that Lennon was homosexual; that he was using drugs while living at the Dakota with his son, Sean; that he had become a reclusive rock 'n' roll Howard Hughes.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="31" wdcount="21"> She did acknowledge having a heroin problem during the late 1970s, but rejected Goldman's assertion that she had a $5,000-a-week habit.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="32" wdcount="33"> The book has already drawn angry responses from friends of Lennon and Ono McCartney, who contradicted one anecdote involving Lennon smashing a painting in Paul's home, has urged a boycott of the book.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="33" wdcount="25"> After Yoko's rebuttal, listeners were invited to dial 900-digit telephone numbers to vote on whether the book was an accurate portrayal of the Lennons' life.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="34" wdcount="7"> Results were not expected until later today.</s>
<s docid="AP880915-0066" num="35" wdcount="23"> Goldman, who conducted more than 1,200 interviews for his Lennon book, has written controversial biographies of comedian Lenny Bruce and Elvis Presley .</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="12" wdcount="28"> When celebrity biographer Albert Goldman began digging into ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' his first move was to mail a long, reverential request for help to Yoko Ono.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="13" wdcount="10"> ``She was Numero Uno, you've got to start with her.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="14" wdcount="20"> I sent her a sincere letter, because at that time I was a true believer in rock's greatest love story.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="15" wdcount="10"> ... I told her, `I'm in your corner,''' Goldman recalled.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="16" wdcount="3"> Ono never responded.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="17" wdcount="21"> And after 1,200 interviews and 6 years, the dream was over for Goldman, his mythic view of Lennon the Great altered.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="18" wdcount="34"> Expecting the best, Goldman claims to have uncovered the worst: a volatile, debauched Lennon who evolved into the Howard Hughes of rock 'n' roll, tucked in his Dakota bed for days at a time.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="19" wdcount="35"> That vision of the ex-Beatle has infuriated Lennon supporters, family and friends and prompted charges of fiction writing; it also taught Goldman _ who says he is a John Lennon fan _ a hard lesson.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="20" wdcount="7"> ``It doesn't pay to meet your idols.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="21" wdcount="11"> Just enjoy them; don't try to see the reality,'' Goldman said.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="22" wdcount="8"> ``My books are a cold dose of reality.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="23" wdcount="12"> You get in the Beatle shower, and suddenly the water goes cold''.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="24" wdcount="32"> Goldman, whose past tell-all biographies dealt with Elvis Presley and Lenny Bruce, remains unmoved by the hue and cry from the music industry, from Ono and from Lennon's Beatle buddy, Paul McCartney.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="25" wdcount="16"> ``My books are bad for business,'' Goldman said in a phone interview from Munich, West Germany.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="26" wdcount="17"> ``They're bad for Paul's business, bad for Yoko's business, back for the jive myth of rock business.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="27" wdcount="6"> Those people have to hate me''.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="28" wdcount="9"> Myth-shattering is a not a bad thing, Goldman said.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="29" wdcount="13"> For example, he cites Lennon's disillusioning meeting with Presley at Graceland in 1965.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="30" wdcount="6"> ``John was very hooked into Elvis.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="31" wdcount="8"> Elvis was his measure of success,'' said Goldman.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="32" wdcount="6"> ``And the myth of Elvis: awesome.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="33" wdcount="7"> But the reality of Elvis: a mess''.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="34" wdcount="30"> Goldman also rejected the complaint raised by Ono, McCartney, Julian Lennon and others that Lennon is an easy target to defame because he's no longer around to answer the allegations.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="35" wdcount="7"> ``You can't say John lacks for defenders.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="36" wdcount="4"> And Yoko isn't dead.</s>

<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="39" wdcount="11"> They can do something about it,'' said Goldman, his voice quickening.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="40" wdcount="11"> ``This business of making it easy for defending myself is insane.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="41" wdcount="7"> I'm the target of scores of attacks.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="42" wdcount="9"> I can't imagine a harder thing for an author''.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="43" wdcount="21"> Those attacks don't really bother him, unless they come from someone who hasn't read ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' Goldman said.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="44" wdcount="9"> ``A lot of people already made up their minds.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="45" wdcount="28"> They hear Albert Goldman, John Lennon, homosexuality _ bang, let him have it! I resent people commenting on a book they haven't read, including Yoko,'' the author said.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="46" wdcount="11"> Ono's reaction came on a nationally broadcast response to the book.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="47" wdcount="24"> She labeled Goldman's version of life with the Lennons ``totally fiction'' and brought out Lennon's sons, Julian and 12-year-old Sean, to refute the biography.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="48" wdcount="23"> ``These giant promotions of Yoko are presented as honest documentaries, when they're in-house documentaries,'' said Goldman, who complimented Ono on a well-prepared show.</s>

<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="51" wdcount="36"> As for the sensational charges of bisexuality, drug abuse by Yoko and John, wild drinking binges, anorexia and reclusiveness, Goldman says it all fits together with the image of Lennon presented by those who knew him.</s>
<s docid="AP880921-0201" num="52" wdcount="9"> ``My thesis is John Lennon was a divided mind.</s>

<s docid="AP890119-0266" num="18" wdcount="8"> Giuliano wanted to do a book about Lennon.</s>
<s docid="AP890119-0266" num="19" wdcount="16"> Baird wanted to do a book about the ex-Beatle's maligned mother, whose name also was Julia.</s>

<s docid="AP890119-0266" num="21" wdcount="33"> Baird disagrees with other biographies which say that after his father decamped and Julia turned her son over to her sister, Mimi, Lennon was a grim youth who felt abandoned by his mother.</s>
<s docid="AP890119-0266" num="22" wdcount="8"> ``I didn't do it for John,'' said Baird.</s>

<s docid="AP890119-0266" num="25" wdcount="22"> Baird, a 41-year-old teacher in Cheshire, England, was born seven years after Lennon to Julia and her common-law second husband, John Dykins.</s>

<s docid="AP890119-0266" num="27" wdcount="28"> The book tells of the sisters getting hauled out of the bathtub when teen-agers Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison drop by for bathroom jam sessions with Julia.</s>
<s docid="AP890119-0266" num="28" wdcount="54"> It tells of an alternately thoughtless and protective brother who leaves his step-sisters at the movies for hours while he goes on a date, who between songs at a Beatles concert shouts for security guards to lift the Dykins girls out of the front row, away from screaming fans threatening to storm the stage.</s>
<s docid="AP890119-0266" num="29" wdcount="17"> But mostly it tells of a mother and son who, while living apart, had a loving relationship.</s>
<s docid="AP890119-0266" num="30" wdcount="21"> The book got its start after Baird watched a British television special in 1985 marking the fifth anniversary of Lennon's murder.</s>

<s docid="AP890119-0266" num="42" wdcount="29"> The end of the book describes what Baird calls Lennon's desire to regain his lost Liverpool roots, when she and her step-brother exchanged letters and phone calls during 1975-80.</s>
<s docid="AP890119-0266" num="43" wdcount="24"> Baird has been accused of cashing in on her step-brother but insists she just wants to tell the family's story of Lennon's early years.</s>

<s docid="AP901121-0207" num="13" wdcount="22"> Lennon had been in virtual seclusion for five years, busy taking care of his son, Sean, and admittedly out of songwriting ideas.</s>
<s docid="AP901121-0207" num="14" wdcount="24"> But in 1980, he suddenly felt inspired again and planned to return to the studio to make an album with his wife, Yoko Ono.</s>
<s docid="AP901121-0207" num="15" wdcount="7"> It was more than a superstar session.</s>
<s docid="AP901121-0207" num="16" wdcount="12"> Afterall, Lennon gave no press conferences, and didn't attend clubs or concerts.</s>
<s docid="AP901121-0207" num="17" wdcount="22"> Rare photos occasionally emerged and he looked different in each one (Lennon jokingly referred to himself as ``Greta Hughes'' and ``Howard Garbo'').</s>
<s docid="AP901121-0207" num="18" wdcount="25"> Producer Jack Douglas, who had worked with Lennon as an engineer, recruited Newmark, bassist Tony Levin, guitarist Hugh McCracken and other New York-based sessions players.</s>
<s docid="AP901121-0207" num="19" wdcount="11"> Recording was to take place at the Hit Factory in Manhattan.</s>
<s docid="AP901121-0207" num="20" wdcount="10"> To Newmark, Lennon was a hero and only a hero.</s>
<s docid="AP901121-0207" num="21" wdcount="11"> He didn't know him and was nervous about working with him.</s>

<s docid="AP901121-0207" num="23" wdcount="7"> Lennon was those things - and more.</s>
<s docid="AP901121-0207" num="24" wdcount="31"> ``His personality seemed so consistent with all we had ever heard about John Lennon,'' said Newmark, who still lives in New York and works with former Roxy Music singer Bryan Ferry.</s>

<s docid="AP901121-0207" num="32" wdcount="19"> Once recording began, Lennon was just a ``working musician'' with the same goal as everyone else: finishing the album.</s>
<s docid="AP901121-0207" num="33" wdcount="12"> The music was mostly mainstream pop; no 18-minute jams or political anthems.</s>
<s docid="AP901121-0207" num="34" wdcount="10"> ``I hate all that fancy stuff,'' Lennon told his drummer.</s>

<s docid="AP901121-0207" num="36" wdcount="18"> He was a happy man at this point and his singing was higher, sweeter than on earlier albums.</s>
<s docid="AP901121-0207" num="37" wdcount="19"> Lennon was hoping to get back in touch with his audience, and the songs were melodic, the production lush.</s>
<s docid="AP901121-0207" num="38" wdcount="12"> ``Dear Yoko'' and ``Grow Old With Me'' were tributes to his wife.</s>
<s docid="AP901121-0207" num="39" wdcount="7"> ``Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)'' was for Sean.</s>

<s docid="AP901208-0076" num="7" wdcount="29"> Dozens of fans of rock legend and former Beatle John Lennon gathered in the snow on a windy Saturday for a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of his death.</s>
<s docid="AP901208-0076" num="8" wdcount="27"> Liverpool's mayor, Dorothy Gavin, led Lennon devotees who laid wreaths at the foot of a bronze statue of The Beatles in the city's Cavern Walks shopping center.</s>
<s docid="AP901208-0076" num="9" wdcount="29"> The center was built on the original site of the Cavern Club, made famous when The Beatles played there in the 1960s, and has become a place of pilgrimage.</s>
<s docid="AP901208-0076" num="10" wdcount="19"> ``Give peace a chance,'' the title of one of singer-songwriter Lennon's greatest hits, was the theme for the day.</s>
<s docid="AP901208-0076" num="11" wdcount="24"> Many friends and followers of Lennon were present, including Father Tom McKenzie, immortalized as Father MacKenzie in The Beatles' l966 hit song ``Eleanor Rigby''.</s>
<s docid="AP901208-0076" num="12" wdcount="28"> On Friday, a small group of invited guests had gathered at Liverpool's Beatles Museum to watch Mrs. Gavin unveil a plaque marking the 10th anniversary of Lennon's death.</s>
<s docid="AP901208-0076" num="13" wdcount="36"> ``John was always a son of Liverpool and over the last 10 years Liverpool has been very slow to recognize the fact that the Beatles came from Liverpool,'' said Lennon biographer Ray Coleman after the unveiling.</s>
<s docid="AP901208-0076" num="14" wdcount="20"> ``It is right that a world figure like Lennon should be recognized at last,'' said Coleman, author of ``John Lennon''.</s>
<s docid="AP901208-0076" num="15" wdcount="48"> Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, were returning to their apartment in New York's Dakota apartment building after a recording session on Dec. 8, 1980, when Lennon was shot to death by Mark David Chapman, a deranged fan to whom Lennon had given his autograph only hours before.</s>
<s docid="AP901208-0076" num="16" wdcount="3"> Lennon was 40.</s>
<s docid="AP901208-0076" num="17" wdcount="23"> A spokesman for the Lennon family said Ms. Ono and the couple's son, Sean, were in Europe and would spend the anniversary privately.</s>
<s docid="AP901208-0076" num="18" wdcount="35"> Journalist Andy Peebles, the last person to interview Lennon before he was shot, said in an interview with Sky satellitetelevision news: ``Ten years on, it's a ghastly feeling to think that you had spent ...</s>
<s docid="AP901208-0076" num="19" wdcount="3"> seven hours ...</s>
<s docid="AP901208-0076" num="20" wdcount="16"> with somebody you have been a fan of for years, and I think I left ...</s>
<s docid="AP901208-0076" num="21" wdcount="9"> thinking `This is great, he's in really good shape'''.</s>
<s docid="AP901208-0076" num="22" wdcount="28"> Peebles said late in 1980 that Lennon had just recovered from a period when he had ``gone off the rails'' and his relationship with Ms. Ono had suffered.</s>
<s docid="AP901208-0076" num="23" wdcount="17"> ``But (when I saw him) they'd had the baby, Sean had been born, and everything was great.''</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="12" wdcount="15"> Who could possibly regard her as anything other than a crackpot and a public menace?</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="13" wdcount="25"> Well, let's see: there's party rockers the B52s and cult singer Lene Lovich -- successful, critically acclaimed musicians who credit Ono's music as an influence.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="14" wdcount="25"> There's the Whitney Museum of Art, which exhibited Ono's artwork last year -- one of the 10 museum shows she has had around the world.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="15" wdcount="18"> There's also the American Film Institute, which Ono says is staging an international tour of her experimental films.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="16" wdcount="23"> And Ono's record label -- "they want to put out all my songs in a kind of CD box or something," Ono says.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="17" wdcount="3"> Surprised? So's Ono.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="18" wdcount="5"> She's used to rougher treatment.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="19" wdcount="7"> Acceptance is a difficult concept for her.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="20" wdcount="27"> "I'm used to sort of knocking the door rather than having the door opened and having to cope with entering it," Ono says during a telephone interview.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="21" wdcount="21"> She's speaking from the New York office of Bag One Arts, the company Ono founded to promote Lennon's art and image.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="22" wdcount="70"> Marketing an icon; Since his death in 1980, Ono has steadily kept Lennon products coming out: the albums "Milk and Honey" and "Menlove Avenue" and the 4-CD boxed set "The John Lennon Collection"; the book "Skywriting by Word of Mouth," a collection of Lennon's unpublished writings; Lennon's art, which Ono says was his main interest in his final years; and Lennon-inspired merchandise, such as a line of John Lennon eyeglasses.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="23" wdcount="13"> "I told the fans that I'm going to do 10 years of it.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="24" wdcount="15"> Every year, hopefully, give a new product and share it with the fans," Ono says.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="25" wdcount="26"> "Some years, we had two or three products of John that came out."; The 10-year promise ended with last year's year-long celebration of Lennon's 50th birthday.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="26" wdcount="36"> In 1991, Ono says, she has tried to "relax a little and do my own stuff."; Ono, 57, has been going into a recording studio every day to work on the proposed boxed-set of her music.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="27" wdcount="13"> She continues to produce art and recently had a museum exhibit in Iceland.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="28" wdcount="12"> Ono began her art career as an abstract impressionist, then went avant-garde.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="29" wdcount="21"> She began doing performance art in the early '60s, long before the form was legitimized by art critics and government grants.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="30" wdcount="15"> A life in two worlds; Ono declines to put a label on her current works.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="31" wdcount="8"> She says that's for the critics to decide.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="32" wdcount="7"> "I just like to create," she says.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="33" wdcount="20"> Ono still lives in the Dakota apartment house in New York, the site of Lennon's murder by a crazed fan.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="34" wdcount="37"> On Dec. 8, 1980, the couple was returning home from the recording studio where they had been remixing "Walking on Thin Ice," one of the songs that would appear on Ono's most successful album, "Season of Glass".</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="35" wdcount="12"> As they approached the entrance to the building, someone called out "Mr.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="36" wdcount="15"> Lennon"? Lennon turned, and Mark David Chapman shot him five times with a .38 revolver.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="37" wdcount="14"> After Lennon's death, there was speculation that Ono would leave the United States forever.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="38" wdcount="7"> She did begin living part-time in Geneva.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="39" wdcount="14"> "My theory was that I would live more and more in Geneva," Ono says.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="40" wdcount="16"> "But it seems like circumstances are making me come back more and more to New York.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="41" wdcount="10"> This is my hometown, that's how I feel about it.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="42" wdcount="32"> It's a place where I can work very well."; Ono was born in Tokyo -- her name means "Ocean Child" -- and came with her family to the United States in 1936.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="43" wdcount="23"> Ono lived with her family in San Francisco and New York until the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor forced them to return home.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="44" wdcount="8"> In 1951, the Onos returned to New York.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="46" wdcount="5"> The marriage lasted seven years.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="47" wdcount="12"> Ono married a second time in 1963, to avant-garde artist Tony Cox.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="48" wdcount="9"> The couple had one child, a daughter named Kyoko.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="49" wdcount="6"> In 1966, Ono and Lennon met.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="50" wdcount="9"> He too was married and had a child, Julian.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="51" wdcount="7"> Ono and Lennon were married in 1970.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="52" wdcount="10"> There has been much speculation on Ono and Lennon's relationship.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="53" wdcount="5"> Some say she controlled him.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="54" wdcount="8"> "John was an extremely strong person," Ono says.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="55" wdcount="39"> "There was no way to dominate him, even if I wanted to."; Others say Lennon used his relationship with Ono as an escape from things in his life that he felt were controlling him -- such as the Beatles.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="56" wdcount="29"> In May 1968, when the Beatles came together at the studio to work on "The Beatles," the two-record set commonly called "The White Album," Ono was at Lennon's side.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="57" wdcount="4"> The two were inseparable.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="58" wdcount="16"> According to at least one Beatles biographer, Ono even accompanied Lennon on trips to the bathroom.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="59" wdcount="15"> The relationship between the Beatles -- especially Lennon and Paul McCartney -- was already strained.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="60" wdcount="15"> Having Ono in the studio, offering suggestions and backing Lennon up in arguments, didn't help.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="61" wdcount="26"> Still, the group already seemed headed toward a break-up, which finally came when McCartney sued the other Beatles to resolve an argument over the group's management.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="62" wdcount="8"> So, no, Ono didn't break up the Beatles.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="63" wdcount="12"> But it's also true that three of them didn't like her much.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="64" wdcount="20"> Life after John; "I think the very fact that John and I got together hurt them a lot," she says.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="65" wdcount="2"> "It's 50/50.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="66" wdcount="7"> We hurt them and they hurt us.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="67" wdcount="18"> I can't really say it's a one-sided situation."; Ono says she feels no bitterness toward the surviving Beatles.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="68" wdcount="10"> "Songwriters in this world are pretty harmless people," she says.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="69" wdcount="18"> "They're not doing anything like creating a nuclear bomb or trying to decide whether people should be killed.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="70" wdcount="11"> They're pretty peaceful people and their songs will hopefully inspire people.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="71" wdcount="18"> I have a lot of respect for them."; But how do the Beatles feel toward Ono these days?</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="72" wdcount="4"> "It varies," she says.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="73" wdcount="16"> "Sometimes they are friendly, sometimes they are not . . . like all relationships with friends.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="74" wdcount="29"> I think that's natural."; Many of the books that have been written about Lennon and the Beatles, especially Albert Goldman's loathing portrait of Lennon, have been painful to Ono.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="75" wdcount="11"> But she says she isn't sure about writing her own version.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="76" wdcount="19"> "I was hurt very much, and my son, too, by some of the things that were written," she says.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06231192" num="78" wdcount="35"> "Then again, when I think of writing my true story . . . I could say 'this is the truth' and write about things somebody did or whatever, but then I think about their children.</s>

<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="4" wdcount="34"> Say what you want about Albert Goldman, the author of the new biography, "The Lives of John Lennon" (Morrow, $22.95), but you've got to hand it to him: This guy is one ambitious sleazemonger.</s>
<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="5" wdcount="46"> Most best-selling pop biographers play it safe: They choose a celeb of respectable, not to say pristine, reputation, and then they proceed to blacken it, preferably by recounting vaguely sourced tales of sexual excess, chemical dependency, personal unkindness, raw business dealings, even, in some cases, dyslexia.</s>
<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="6" wdcount="38"> The resulting portrait of a dissipated ogre who can't spell is duly presented in hardback form to the public, which in turn is so shocked and disgusted that it forces itself to buy the biography by the millions.</s>
<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="7" wdcount="4"> A can't-miss formula, surely.</s>
<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="8" wdcount="10"> Albert Goldman's previous victim in the genre was Elvis Presley.</s>

<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="11" wdcount="34"> His title notwithstanding, the "King of Rock 'n' Roll" was in truth more a creature of the old show biz, a star whose wholesome image, carefully created by P.R. wizards, was ripe for debunking.</s>
<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="12" wdcount="19"> But in choosing Mr. Lennon as his next target, Mr. Goldman appears to be trying to debunk the undebunkable.</s>
<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="13" wdcount="7"> For apart from his puerile politics, Mr.</s>
<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="14" wdcount="30"> Lennon's favorite topic in the thousands of interviews he gave was his own squalid history: His voracious drug use, his perfidy to employees, his unquenchable sexual promiscuity and so on.</s>
<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="15" wdcount="18"> By his own accounting, then, Mr. Lennon was not about to dethrone Ward Cleaver as the all-American dad.</s>
<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="16" wdcount="16"> His public loved him in spite of it all -- or perhaps because of it all.</s>
<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="17" wdcount="22"> Mr. Lennon grew to celebrity during a time when such transgressions as intemperance and adultery (quaint terms)! were losing their social sting.</s>
<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="18" wdcount="15"> His candor -- if that's what it was, and not simple logorrhea -- redeemed everything.</s>
<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="19" wdcount="21"> And so it is on the grounds of insufficient candor that the resourceful Mr. Goldman, hot to debunk, attacks his subject.</s>

<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="21" wdcount="28"> Lennon's confessions was that his worst days were behind him, and that with Yoko Ono he had at last learned to prize the virtues of quietude and domesticity.</s>

<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="23" wdcount="65"> Hence this 718-page stew of unrelieved sordidness, percolating with the "scoops" that have by now been widely publicized in People magazine, "West 57th" and other scholarly venues: that Mr. Lennon had a thing for young boys; that his marriage to Ms. Ono was pocked by the same faithlessness and rancor that characterized his first marriage; that he had a sweet tooth that just wouldn't quit.</s>
<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="24" wdcount="13"> The squalid revelations dribble out like a chemical leak, sliming up every page.</s>

<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="26" wdcount="11"> Goldman's John Lennon is even worse than John Lennon's John Lennon.</s>
<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="27" wdcount="37"> A great deal of this muck manages to splash onto Ms. Ono, whom Mr. Goldman portrays as a cynical manipulator whose major talent lay in exploiting Mr. Lennon to further her own craving for fame and wealth.</s>
<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="28" wdcount="22"> Mr. Goldman, alas, allows to pass unremarked the obvious irony that this is a rather fine thumbnail sketch of himself as well.</s>
<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="29" wdcount="15"> The keepers of the Lennon flame have of course been quick to point this out.</s>
<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="30" wdcount="23"> Ms. Ono and her son have taken the path preferred by offended celebrities, they have hit the talk shows to display their wounds.</s>
<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="31" wdcount="34"> And Rolling Stone magazine, long the house organ for the Lennon publicity machine, recently published an extensive rebuttal to the book, which was undercut by a tone of priggish indignation bordering on the comic.</s>
<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="32" wdcount="29"> Criticizing "The Lives of John Lennon" for insufficient respect to the fallen Beatle's legacy is rather off the point -- like condemning Charles Manson for his bad table manners.</s>
<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="33" wdcount="10"> The book may indeed be inaccurate, as critics have charged.</s>
<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="34" wdcount="20"> But one can only hope that quibbles about its veracity do not obscure the countless other reasons to hate Mr.</s>

<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="36" wdcount="35"> There is, for starters, the sloppy, pompous prose, so suggestive of the grad-school smoking lounge -- Mr. Goldman is the sort of writer who refers to pop songs as "pieces," as though they were concerti.</s>

<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="39" wdcount="47"> And there is the awkward organization, in which minor events assume large proportions for the simple reason that they reflect badly on Mr. Lennon, while major events are skipped over lightly because -- there goes the advance! -- they might reveal Mr. Lennon in a flattering light.</s>
<s docid="WSJ881021-0008" num="40" wdcount="54"> All of which indicates why "The Lives of John Lennon" is such a wretched book: not because it makes a good man look bad, but because it shows no other purpose than to make a man -- whether a good man or a bad one, we laymen will probably never know -- look bad.</s>
