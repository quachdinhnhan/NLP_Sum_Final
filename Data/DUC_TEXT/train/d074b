<s docid="SJMN91-06256107" num="19" wdcount="43"> Heflin cited the "appearance of a confirmation conversion" and said it may raise questions of Thomas' "integrity and temperament."; But Heflin added, "I am not at this time of any firm opinion one way or the other" on whether Thomas should be confirmed.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06256107" num="20" wdcount="56"> And Simon said Thomas' performance thus far "has neither helped him nor hurt him."; Specter blamed fellow committee members more than Thomas in concluding, "We really haven't moved very far in the process."; Thomas, a black federal appeals judge, was picked by President Bush to replace the retiring Thurgood Marshall, the high court's only black justice.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06256107" num="21" wdcount="19"> DeConcini said he thought the conservative Thomas "handled the privacy questions very well" without taking a stand on abortion.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06256107" num="22" wdcount="42"> "I don't see how you could ask him to do anything more."; Thomas expanded earlier testimony by saying Wednesday that he believed the right of marital privacy was "fundamental" -- a status that accords it the fullest judicial protection from government intrusion.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06256107" num="23" wdcount="19"> But he repeatedly refused to state his views on the 1973 abortion decision based on women's right of privacy.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06256107" num="24" wdcount="56"> To give such an answer, he said, "would undermine my ability to sit in an impartial way on such an important case."; Thomas, who sat alone at the witness table with no notes or reference materials, also claimed a lack of familiarity with the subject matter when asked about some of his former speeches and articles.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06256107" num="25" wdcount="7"> That moved committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06256107" num="26" wdcount="22"> , to give Thomas a stack of the judge's past speeches so the nominee could "help me understand them" during future questioning.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06256107" num="27" wdcount="21"> Thomas, testifying calmly but warily, did offer fuller comment on another hot issue before the high court: prayer in public schools.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06256107" num="28" wdcount="63"> After Simon discussed the feelings decades ago of a Jewish elementary schoolboy who left the room each day while his classmates recited a prayer, Thomas said, "Any policy of exclusion should be considered inappropriate."; Outside the hearing room, abortion-rights advocates said Thomas should not be allowed to disavow past comments they say show he would vote to ban most, if not all, abortions.</s>
<s docid="SJMN91-06256107" num="29" wdcount="41"> "His most unimpressive testimony poses two equally disturbing possibilities: he is either willfully misleading the committee about his views to win confirmation, or he is a man whose convictions have shallow roots," said Arthur Kropp of People for the American Way.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06256107" num="31" wdcount="24"> , said he could not understand how Thomas' prior statements touching on the 1973 abortion decision could have been made without considering its content.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06256107" num="33" wdcount="56"> Although Thomas appeared to back away from comments made in past speeches or articles, he told the committee, "My view is that I have been consistent."; Thomas' opponents believe Republicans Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Charles Grassley of Iowa, Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Hank Brown of Colorado are solid Thomas backers.</s>
