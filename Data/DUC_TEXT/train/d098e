<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="27" wdcount="18"> ``We're backing up to a very deliberate and slow and careful approach to these problems,'' Olivier said Friday.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="28" wdcount="9"> ``This is not the time to do anything dumb''.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="29" wdcount="26"> The telescope problems have put the flight center several days behind, but the five astronauts who deployed it earlier this week were sticking to their schedule.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="30" wdcount="25"> Landing is scheduled for 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., but flight controllers were keeping a close watch on the weather.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="31" wdcount="14"> Winds were predicted to be about 20 mph with gusts up to 29 mph.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="32" wdcount="11"> Mission rules dictate that headwinds cannot exceed 29 mph at touchdown.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="33" wdcount="17"> The shuttle carries enough supplies to stay in orbit three days beyond Sunday if necessary, NASA said.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="34" wdcount="17"> Mission Control awakened the crew members at about 1:30 a.m. EDT today by playing the song, ``Cosmos''.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="35" wdcount="14"> ``Thanks for the wake-up music, it's pretty appropriate for today,'' said Commander Loren Shriver.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="36" wdcount="22"> ``The song was selected in honor of Hubble Space Telescope, which is now open for business,'' said Mission Control commentator James Hartsfield.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="37" wdcount="17"> The astronauts were to finish up their experiments and photography today and pack for the trip home.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="38" wdcount="17"> They also planned to hold a news conference from space with reporters at the Johnson Space Center.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="39" wdcount="28"> Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden were to run through a series of tests to make certain the shuttle's computers and control jets were ready for return to Earth.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="40" wdcount="23"> The crew deployed Hubble on Wednesday but they had stayed close to the telescope in case there was trouble opening the aperture door.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="41" wdcount="25"> Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in orbit 380 miles above Earth.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="42" wdcount="24"> But that proved unnecessary when the door was opened Friday morning, exposing the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch eye to starlight for the first time.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="43" wdcount="20"> Two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working when the door opened, but engineers later got them back on line.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="44" wdcount="27"> The gyroscopes were knocked out by the motion and that, too, kept the telescope in the safe mode, said Dave Drachlis, director of orbital verifications at Goddard.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="45" wdcount="21"> A colleague, Steve Terry, said Hubble's systems were set at conservative limits for the first operations and that caused many malfunctions.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="46" wdcount="9"> There also were two communications outages totaling several hours.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="47" wdcount="31"> Hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be ``the master of its own destiny'' in case contact with an orbiting communications system is lost for extended periods, Terry said.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="48" wdcount="23"> NASA had planned to release its first test image from the telescope on Tuesday, showing an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="49" wdcount="12"> But Terry said that would be delayed because of the antenna problems.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="50" wdcount="9"> Scientific data will follow in a month or two.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="51" wdcount="32"> The telescope, named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, will enable astronomers over its 15-year working lifetime to look back 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of the universe.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="52" wdcount="17"> The universe is believed to have been created about 15 billion years ago in a cosmic explosion.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="53" wdcount="10"> Hubble provided the basis for the big-bang theory of creation.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="54" wdcount="26"> He discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding and that the farther the galaxy is from Earth, the faster it is moving away .</s>
