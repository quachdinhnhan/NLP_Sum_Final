<s docid="AP880711-0056" num="9" wdcount="29"> The agency projects world cereal production in 1988 to total 1.785 billion tons, only two million tons more than last year's level, which was already below the expected production.</s>
<s docid="AP880711-0056" num="10" wdcount="37"> If the drought in the United States ended now, grain production would fall close to the low levels of 1983, when a drought and farmers' participation in a government crop reduction program decreased output, the agency reported.</s>
<s docid="AP880711-0056" num="11" wdcount="32"> As a result, world grain stocks are projected to fall below 310 million tons, or 17 percent of the level the agency considers necessary to safeguard world food security, the report said.</s>
<s docid="AP880711-0056" num="12" wdcount="18"> If crop conditions in the United States and Canada continue to deteriorate, the ratio could drop even further.</s>
<s docid="AP880711-0056" num="13" wdcount="20"> ``Such a development would have serious implications for the food security, particularly of many low-income, food-deficit countries,'' the report said.</s>
<s docid="AP880711-0056" num="14" wdcount="20"> The high grain prices resulting from a lower supply would hit poor, food-importing countries the hardest, the U.N. agency warned.</s>
<s docid="AP880711-0056" num="15" wdcount="13"> It said the rising prices could also reduce food aid from developed countries.</s>
<s docid="AP880711-0056" num="16" wdcount="17"> The most severely hit crops are coarse grains _ mostly maize, barley and oats, the report said.</s>

<s docid="AP880711-0221" num="12" wdcount="21"> In 1934, more than 60 percent was so rated, and in August 1954 more than 50 percent was in that category.</s>
<s docid="AP880711-0221" num="13" wdcount="33"> ``Because of the large early season area now experiencing drought in the U.S., 1988 appears to have the potential to approach or exceed the drought-affected areas of the 1930s and 1950s,'' Lyng said.</s>
<s docid="AP880711-0221" num="14" wdcount="39"> Even with the severe drought, there will be an adequate supply of food grains and livestock feed grains so that the United States ``will be able to take care of our domestic needs and our export demand,'' he said.</s>
<s docid="AP880711-0221" num="15" wdcount="20"> Lyng said total consumption of 1988 crops will probably be somewhat less than previously estimated because prices are much higher.</s>
