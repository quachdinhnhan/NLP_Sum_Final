<s docid="AP880428-0041" num="9" wdcount="36"> New treatments that stop a heart attack in its tracks may help victims to get out of the hospital more quickly than ever before, perhaps even three days after their attacks, a study published today concludes.</s>
<s docid="AP880428-0041" num="10" wdcount="21"> Doctors from the University of Michigan Medical Center studied the effects of sending a few carefully selected heart patients home early.</s>
<s docid="AP880428-0041" num="11" wdcount="20"> They found that these people had no unusual complications, got back to work sooner and had substantially lower medical bills.</s>
<s docid="AP880428-0041" num="12" wdcount="14"> ``It was an extraordinarily safe strategy,'' said Dr. Eric J. Topol, the study's director.</s>
<s docid="AP880428-0041" num="13" wdcount="8"> ``There were no problems with any serious events''.</s>
<s docid="AP880428-0041" num="14" wdcount="21"> Topol said the early discharges were made possible by two recent medical advances _ tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, and angioplasty.</s>
<s docid="AP880428-0041" num="15" wdcount="18"> When given quickly after a heart attack, TPA can dissolve clots in the heart's arteries and minimize damage.</s>
<s docid="AP880428-0041" num="16" wdcount="14"> Angioplasty can produce similar results by opening up the clogged arteries with tiny balloons.</s>
<s docid="AP880428-0041" num="17" wdcount="23"> The report represents the latest in a steady three-decade trend of sending heart attack patients home from the hospital after ever shorter stays.</s>
<s docid="AP880428-0041" num="18" wdcount="21"> However, the study in the New England Journal of Medicine said more research is needed before the findings are widely adopted.</s>
<s docid="AP880428-0041" num="19" wdcount="20"> In the 1950s, doctors often recommended that patients stay in bed for one to two months after a heart attack.</s>

<s docid="AP880428-0041" num="23" wdcount="17"> In the 1960s, the stay was shortened to three weeks and in the 1970s to two weeks.</s>
<s docid="AP880428-0041" num="24" wdcount="12"> Now, doctors typically keep heart attack patients hospitalized seven to 10 days.</s>
<s docid="AP880428-0041" num="25" wdcount="24"> In their paper, the doctors determined that 80 of the 507 heart attack patients studied were healthy enough to be considered for early discharge.</s>

<s docid="AP880428-0041" num="28" wdcount="16"> Forty patients were sent home after three days, while the rest stayed seven to 10 days.</s>
<s docid="AP880428-0041" num="29" wdcount="19"> After six months of followup, none had died, and the number of medical problems in both groups was similar.</s>
<s docid="AP880428-0041" num="30" wdcount="31"> However, people in the early discharge group were able to return to work about two weeks sooner than the others, and their medical bills were significantly lower _ $12,546 versus $17,868.</s>
<s docid="AP880428-0041" num="31" wdcount="26"> The researchers estimated that if 15 percent of all heart attack patients were discharged after three days, the annual saving would be at least $280 million.</s>
<s docid="AP880428-0041" num="32" wdcount="32"> In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Gregory D. Curfman, a deputy editor of the journal, cautioned that the study was not large enough to spot complications that might result from reducing hospital stays.</s>
<s docid="AP880428-0041" num="33" wdcount="30"> ``This single study,'' he wrote, ``is not sufficient to justify sweeping changes in current management practices for all patients who may at first appear to have uncomplicated'' heart attacks .</s>
<s docid="AP880818-0088" num="9" wdcount="39"> A drug used to treat patients complaining of chest pain also could help prevent recurring heart attacks in four out of five heart patients, according to a study published in today's edition of the New England Journal of Medicine.</s>
<s docid="AP880818-0088" num="10" wdcount="25"> Surprisingly, however, the study found that the drug, diltiazem, increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack in patients whose hearts pump abnormally, experts said.</s>
<s docid="AP880818-0088" num="11" wdcount="24"> Even so, the results may trigger an increase in the use of the drug, which is now primarily used to treat angina, doctors said.</s>
<s docid="AP880818-0088" num="12" wdcount="43"> The drug was tested in 38 hospitals in the United States and Canada on patients who had recently suffered a heart attack, said Dr. Arthur Moss, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Rochester and the principal investigator for the study.</s>
<s docid="AP880818-0088" num="13" wdcount="25"> The results suggest the drug may be quite effective in decreasing the likelihood of a second heart attack in the majority of patients, Moss said.</s>
<s docid="AP880818-0088" num="14" wdcount="28"> But the study also surprisingly suggests that patients who suffer pulmonary congestion should not be given diltiazem because the drug increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack.</s>
<s docid="AP880818-0088" num="15" wdcount="14"> ``We now know when to prescribe this drug and when not to,'' Moss said.</s>
<s docid="AP880818-0088" num="16" wdcount="7"> ``That's what this study was all about''.</s>

<s docid="AP880818-0088" num="19" wdcount="20"> The study involved 2,466 heart attack patients, who were given either 240 milligrams of diltiazem a day or a placebo.</s>
<s docid="AP880818-0088" num="20" wdcount="14"> Patients were recruited from 1983 to 1986 and followed for 12 to 52 months.</s>
<s docid="AP880818-0088" num="21" wdcount="17"> Overall, the drug only decreased additional heart attacks 11 percent, which was not statistically significant, Moss said.</s>
<s docid="AP880818-0088" num="22" wdcount="35"> But in patients who had normal or near-normal heart pump function _ 1,909 patients or 80 percent of the total group _ diltiazem decreased the chance of another heart attack by 25 percent, Moss said.</s>
<s docid="AP880818-0088" num="23" wdcount="25"> In patients whose hearts had pumping problems, the drug not only didn't help, but it increased the chance of a heart attack by 25 percent.</s>
<s docid="AP880818-0088" num="24" wdcount="33"> Dr. John Schroeder, a cardiologist and professor at Stanford University, said he was surprised that the drug increased the chance of heart attack in any group and that overall results were not higher.</s>
<s docid="AP880818-0088" num="25" wdcount="20"> ``But the bottom line is that this is the first study to show that diltiazem can be effective,'' Schroeder said.</s>
<s docid="AP880818-0088" num="26" wdcount="19"> ``I think it will mean that more patients will be routinely put on this drug on a long-term basis''.</s>
<s docid="AP880818-0088" num="27" wdcount="30"> Dr. George Beller, a cardiologist and professor at the University of Virginia, said he was also somewhat surprised about the increase in heart attacks in the group suffering pulmonary congestion.</s>
<s docid="AP880818-0088" num="28" wdcount="14"> ``This is one of the first reports that seems to identify that,'' he said.</s>
<s docid="AP880818-0088" num="29" wdcount="30"> Diltiazem and two other calcium entry blockers were introduced in the past decade, Beller said, and research into how effective they are in various applications is in its early stages.</s>
<s docid="AP880818-0088" num="30" wdcount="18"> Nitrates have been used for more than 50 years, and beta blockers were developed in the 1960s .</s>

<s docid="AP880829-0222" num="13" wdcount="31"> The study was one of a series of recent reports showing for the first time that doctors are able not only to treat heart attacks _ but also to prevent them.</s>
<s docid="AP880829-0222" num="14" wdcount="34"> In the most recent report, doctors found that one aspirin tablet and a single dose of a clot-dissolving drug given within 24 hours can dramatically cut the risk of a second fatal heart attack.</s>
<s docid="AP880829-0222" num="15" wdcount="22"> Without the treatment, patients had a 13 percent chance of dying from a second heart attack within five weeks, the researchers found.</s>
<s docid="AP880829-0222" num="16" wdcount="9"> With the treatment, the figure dropped to 8 percent.</s>
<s docid="AP880829-0222" num="17" wdcount="26"> ``The real discovery is that treatment for patients is going to reduce in-hospital mortality substantially,'' says Richard Peto of Oxford University, one of the study's authors.</s>

<s docid="AP880829-0222" num="22" wdcount="21"> The drugs most responsible for the recent success in preventing heart attacks are the new clot-dissolvers and that old standby, aspirin.</s>
<s docid="AP880829-0222" num="23" wdcount="21"> The usual cause of heart attacks is a blockage of the coronary arteries, which supply the heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood.</s>
<s docid="AP880829-0222" num="24" wdcount="12"> The blockage arises from the buildup of fats, cholesterol and clotted blood.</s>
<s docid="AP880829-0222" num="25" wdcount="8"> Clot-dissolvers break up clots, thus restoring blood flow.</s>
<s docid="AP880829-0222" num="26" wdcount="17"> Aspirin interferes with aspects of the clotting process, helping to prevent clot formation in the first place.</s>
<s docid="AP880829-0222" num="27" wdcount="24"> The limited sales of the clot-dissolving drugs in the United States show that many doctors are still not using them, despite their proven success.</s>

<s docid="AP880829-0222" num="29" wdcount="34"> Some doctors predict that in the not-too-distant future these drugs will be judged so safe that they will be administered routinely by paramedics in ambulances before suspected heart attack victims even reach the hospital.</s>
<s docid="AP880829-0222" num="30" wdcount="43"> ``We have to know how to respond quickly, and we have to have the courage to use these drugs in the absence of definitive diagnosis,'' says Dr. Burton Sobel of Washington University in St. Louis, a pioneer in the testing of the clot-dissolvers.</s>

<s docid="AP880829-0222" num="32" wdcount="30"> While most public attention has focused on this new ability to prevent heart attacks, researchers have also made important progress in speeding the recovery of patients who survive heart attacks.</s>
<s docid="AP880829-0222" num="33" wdcount="28"> Researchers at the University of Michigan recently determined that some heart attack victims can be released from the hospital as soon as three days after their heart attacks.</s>
<s docid="AP880829-0222" num="34" wdcount="16"> Most heart attacks victims are kept in the hospital for at least seven to 10 days.</s>

<s docid="AP881115-0113" num="9" wdcount="36"> The expensive practice of using balloon catheters to force open heart arteries immediately after heart attacks, now routinely done at many large hospitals, is unnecessary and should be abandoned, according to a major study released Tuesday.</s>
<s docid="AP881115-0113" num="10" wdcount="27"> The study found that if heart attack victims quickly receive clot-dissolving drugs, they usually don't need the extra step of the common balloon procedure, known as angioplasty.</s>
<s docid="AP881115-0113" num="11" wdcount="27"> Some experts said the results are good news, because they mean that most heart attack patients can be treated in community hospitals, where angioplasty is not available.</s>

<s docid="AP881115-0113" num="17" wdcount="29"> The first phase of the study showed that giving people a clot-dissolving drug called tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, immediately after heart attacks dramatically improved their chances of survival.</s>
<s docid="AP881115-0113" num="18" wdcount="34"> The latest study, presented at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association, was intended to see whether people did better still if doctors tried to clear away any remaining blockages after giving TPA.</s>
<s docid="AP881115-0113" num="19" wdcount="32"> At 50 hospitals across the United States, doctors randomly assigned 1,636 patients to get angioplasty within two days of their heart attacks if tests showed there was any chance they might benefit.</s>
