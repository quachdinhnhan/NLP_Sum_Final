<s docid="FT923-8766" num="28" wdcount="34"> In his opinion, gearing the marathon to prime-time TV viewing and having the event end at the top of a hill for the sake of stadium spectators was unjustified and a 'sell-out to commercialism.</s>
<s docid="FT923-8766" num="29" wdcount="46"> 'To put on the marathon in the late afternoon, rather than first thing in the morning (the normal practice), and then to make them run 4km up a hill is just criminal in my opinion,' said Brasher, a former Olympic gold medal athlete and noted sportswriter.</s>

<s docid="FT923-8766" num="32" wdcount="16"> Like almost all the athletes running tomorrow, Brace is a professional runner who specialises in marathons.</s>
<s docid="FT923-8766" num="33" wdcount="9"> He takes an objective, long-term view of his profession.</s>
<s docid="FT923-8766" num="34" wdcount="21"> As an income-earner, marathon running is an activity with liabilities and limitations, and requires business management as well as physical ability.</s>
<s docid="FT923-8766" num="35" wdcount="26"> The winner of the London marathon earns a tidy Dollars 50,000 and the New York, Boston and Japanese runs are all in the same prize-winning category.</s>
<s docid="FT923-8766" num="36" wdcount="22"> But these and less financially-rewarding events are physically debilitating, and can only be won if a competitor is in top physical shape.</s>
<s docid="FT923-8766" num="37" wdcount="17"> With their careers and financial prospects in mind, top-level runners normally only run two marathons a year.</s>
<s docid="FT923-8766" num="38" wdcount="22"> As Brace says, when you have only two pay-days out of 365, you choose, plan and train for them with great care.</s>
<s docid="FT923-8766" num="39" wdcount="5"> Brace trains extremely carefully indeed.</s>
<s docid="FT923-8766" num="40" wdcount="9"> 'Running a marathon is the easy part,' he says.</s>
<s docid="FT923-8766" num="41" wdcount="12"> 'The hard part is the lead-up to achieving the performance level required'.</s>
<s docid="FT923-8766" num="42" wdcount="18"> He starts training three months before an event by running 80 miles a week and then building progressively.</s>
<s docid="FT923-8766" num="43" wdcount="11"> For the last six weeks he runs 120 miles a week.</s>
<s docid="FT923-8766" num="44" wdcount="11"> Normally he would hope that such a routine brings a pay-off.</s>
<s docid="FT923-8766" num="45" wdcount="16"> But the Olympic marathon is an exception: the only top-level marathon that carries no prize money.</s>
<s docid="FT923-8766" num="46" wdcount="23"> Brace says that in spite of the prestige and possible financial spin-offs involved, 'it does not necessarily make sense to run to win'.</s>
<s docid="FT923-8766" num="47" wdcount="33"> Given the highly demanding nature of the course and their desire to preserve physical condition for races that do bring in money, he says, many runners will give less than their best effort.</s>
<s docid="FT923-8766" num="48" wdcount="11"> Nonetheless, there are plenty whose considerations stretch beyond the purely financial.</s>
<s docid="FT923-8766" num="49" wdcount="16"> Italian Gelindo Bordin, who came first in the 1988 Seoul Olympic marathon, is a strong contender.</s>

<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="7" wdcount="23"> A crowd the size of a small city will squeeze past a starting line here March 1 to run 26 miles, 385 yards.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="8" wdcount="17"> And cheering every step of that distance will be more than a dozen corporate sponsors and licensees.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="9" wdcount="22"> Makers of cars, soda pop, sportswear, copiers, computers -- even a hospital -- have tagged their names to the Los Angeles Marathon.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="10" wdcount="20"> In the promoter's words, this run is "a marketing event on legs," reflecting marathoning's growing importance in upscale product promotions.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="11" wdcount="7"> Runners, it seems, are a well-heeled lot.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="12" wdcount="18"> A study by Mercedes-Benz found that 42% of family heads making $40,000 a year or more jog regularly.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="13" wdcount="11"> Of potential buyers showing up at Mercedes dealers, 47% are joggers.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="14" wdcount="30"> With those numbers in mind, the car maker has become a sponsor of three marathons -- in New York, Boston and Los Angeles -- as well as other running races.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="15" wdcount="8"> Marathons have had corporate backing for some time.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="16" wdcount="15"> But Los Angeles is ahead of the pack in making distance running a commercial spectacle.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="17" wdcount="45"> The city that invented the corporate-sponsored Olympics has created a marathon unlike others -- artfully dressed as an Olympic-type amateur race, but built from the ground up to make money for the closely held company that controls it -- as well as for the city.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="18" wdcount="19"> "I took air and made an event," says William Burke, the founder and president of Los Angeles Marathon Inc.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="19" wdcount="26"> For a man whose running days ended with his high school track team, Mr. Burke is turning a lot of heads in the world of marathoning.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="20" wdcount="33"> Last year, its first time out, the Los Angeles race attracted nearly 11,000 runners -- four times the number forecast and enough to make it the third -- largest race in the U.S.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="21" wdcount="23"> The event also pulled in about $4 million in cash and services from its sponsors, leaving the organizers with $370,000 in red ink.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="22" wdcount="23"> This year, Mr. Burke and his partner, Marie Patrick, expect to gross about $5 million in cash and services and to break even.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="23" wdcount="8"> Next year, they say, a profit is possible.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="24" wdcount="8"> More than 18,000 runners are expected this year.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="25" wdcount="33"> An audience of perhaps a million and a half or more will line the route, drawn in part by advertisements on 75 million Coca-Cola cans and 2,500 billboards around the Los Angeles area.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="26" wdcount="17"> Marketing experts say the festive atmosphere of big crowds in the streets makes marathons attractive to sponsors.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="27" wdcount="33"> For the cost of a 30-second ad on the Super Bowl, a company can sponsor a marathon and "take over a city," says Lesa Ukman, editor of Special Events Reports, a Chicago-based newsletter.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="28" wdcount="18"> The Los Angeles organizers and sponsors have perhaps done more than their counterparts elsewhere to publicize the event.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="29" wdcount="28"> Los Angelenos are seeing plugs for the race on millions of grocery bags, milk cartons and loaves of bread, in addition to soda cans, billboards and other sources.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="30" wdcount="8"> The venerable New York Marathon is taking note.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="31" wdcount="25"> The New York Road Runners Club, organizer of the race, stopped promoting the event some years ago because it had all the runners it wanted.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="32" wdcount="21"> Now, Fred Lebow, the group's president, says he is encouraging sponsors to promote the race as the Los Angeles sponsors do.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="33" wdcount="7"> The promotion in Los Angeles is unabashed.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="34" wdcount="23"> "We tell people that if they're looking for a new way to crack the Los Angeles market, this is it," says Mr. Burke.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="35" wdcount="40"> The pitch has attracted the likes of Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles; Vons Cos., a large supermarket chain; the Los Angeles Times; the Sears Savings Bank unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co. Eastman Kodak Co., and Tandem Computers Inc.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="36" wdcount="10"> One supporter is Ellesse USA, a sportswear and shoe producer.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="37" wdcount="49"> A $50,000 fee enables the company to use the marathon's name in its ads; Ellesse will spend an additional $100,000 dressing race personnel in T-shirts and warm-up suits, showing its clothes at the marathon's public "Expo" of sponsors' wares, and posting a dozen big street banners along the course.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="38" wdcount="21"> The company has rented more than 500 billboards at a cut-rate price of $120,000 from Patrick Media Group, a marathon sponsor.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="39" wdcount="6"> The discount, about 50%, was important.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="40" wdcount="15"> "We couldn't have bought that kind of exposure normally," says Susan Cialone, Ellesse's advertising director.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="41" wdcount="15"> Ellesse, which also sponsors the New York run, finds the West Coast event more freewheeling.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="42" wdcount="11"> "They have let us do whatever we want," says Ms. Cialone.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="43" wdcount="22"> For instance, product banners along the route -- almost impossible to arrange in New York -- are a snap in Los Angeles.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="44" wdcount="10"> The city, in fact, is a partner in the race.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="45" wdcount="18"> After competitive bidding, it awarded an eight-year contract to Los Angeles Marathon Inc. to put on the race.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="46" wdcount="25"> The exclusive franchise calls for the race organizers this year to pay a minimum $60,000 fee or 4% of gross cash receipts to the city.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="47" wdcount="16"> The organizers also will pay the cost of city services for the marathon, estimated at $100,000.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="48" wdcount="24"> The race sponsors and city officials are trading freely on the good will generated by Los Angeles's role as host of the 1984 Olympics.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="49" wdcount="11"> The logo of the marathon is a shield with laurel wreath.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="50" wdcount="14"> Some posters show the Los Angeles Coliseum with its torch and giant Olympic symbol.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="51" wdcount="10"> "The World Returns to Los Angeles," proclaims one Mercedes-Benz ad.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="52" wdcount="21"> Race directors are called "commissioners," a term borrowed from the 1984 Olympic organization, in which Mr. Burke was commissioner of tennis.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="53" wdcount="18"> And like the Olympics, Los Angeles Marathon Inc., portraying the race as a civic celebration, thrives on volunteers.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="54" wdcount="14"> Some 7,500 people will work for free to monitor the course on race day.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="55" wdcount="10"> And two-thirds of the race's office staff work without pay.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="56" wdcount="13"> "I couldn't buy this," Mr. Burke says, gesturing around the crowded race headquarters.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="57" wdcount="5"> Not everyone works for free.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="58" wdcount="10"> Big-name runners, for instance, want to be paid a lot.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="59" wdcount="7"> And here, the organizers have pinched pennies.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="60" wdcount="27"> While some runners will be paid to appear, this year's field, like last year's, lacks some of the superstars who race in Boston, New York and London.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="61" wdcount="19"> Grete Waitz, one of the best woman marathoners, wanted $100,000 to appear in Los Angeles; she was turned down.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="62" wdcount="38"> Mr. Burke says the Australian runner Rob de Castella made it known through his agent that he wouldn't run any marathons in the spring but, for $25,000, he'd be happy to say the Los Angeles event was tempting.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="63" wdcount="8"> Mr. Burke says he slammed down the phone.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="64" wdcount="20"> "We won't spend extraordinary amounts of money on any single runner to the detriment of the other runners," he says.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="65" wdcount="8"> Mr. de Castella's agent denies the story entirely.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="66" wdcount="14"> What Los Angeles lacks in superstars, it plans to make up for in numbers.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="67" wdcount="15"> This year's race may challenge New York and London as the largest marathon ever run.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="68" wdcount="9"> Some 20,500 started the New York race last year.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="69" wdcount="18"> Mr. Lebow, organizer of the New York event, says next year's Los Angeles Marathon will surpass that number.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="70" wdcount="9"> For one sponsor, this may be a mixed blessing.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="71" wdcount="21"> Orthopaedic Hospital, a not-for-profit institution whose sponsorship is part of a publicity campaign, provides emergency care stations along the marathon route.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="72" wdcount="9"> Last year, one of every 20 runners needed aid.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="73" wdcount="14"> Along with sprains, strains and blisters came more serious cases of exhaustion and hypothermia.</s>
<s docid="WSJ870220-0106" num="74" wdcount="12"> A spokeswoman says: "We advised 250 people to quit the race" .</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="10" wdcount="14"> Mr. Kelley is in training for the Boston Marathon -- his 60th Boston Marathon.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="11" wdcount="31"> And even at the age of 83, he probably will finish ahead of a large number of the 13,000 runners expected to compete -- officially or unofficially -- on April 15.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="12" wdcount="17"> Bill Rodgers, a four-time Boston Marathon winner who plans to run again this year, marvels at Mr.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="13" wdcount="13"> Kelley: "It's incomprehensible that a man his age is doing what he's doing.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="14" wdcount="7"> I'm struggling at the age of 43.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="15" wdcount="6"> . . . This isn't golf".</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="16" wdcount="17"> Even the thought of running a course of 26 miles and 385 yards leaves some of Mr.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="17" wdcount="5"> Kelley's rivals of yesteryear gasping.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="18" wdcount="22"> "Aghast is more like it," says Leslie Pawson, 86, a three-time Boston champion who ran against Mr. Kelley half a century ago.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="19" wdcount="6"> "My doctor says: `No running, whatsoever'.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="20" wdcount="10"> I can't even remember when I ran my last marathon".</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="21" wdcount="18"> John Adelbert Kelley is a throwback to a time when marathoners did it for glory and cab fare.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="22" wdcount="33"> A two-time winner in Boston (1935 and 1945) and runner-up seven times, Mr. Kelley is to be the oldest competitor in the race this year -- as he has been for 15 years.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="23" wdcount="19"> Mr. Kelley is such an institution that Hopkinton, Mass., where the race begins, has made him an honorary citizen.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="24" wdcount="11"> ("That means I don't have to pay taxes there," he jokes).</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="25" wdcount="29"> Two state troopers will run alongside the 5-foot-6, 130-pound Mr. Kelley into Boston so he won't be trampled by "groupies," as he calls them, clamoring to shake his hand.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="26" wdcount="22"> Last year, five Japanese runners were waved away by the bodyguards, as they sidled up to the old celebrity during the race.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="27" wdcount="17"> Recalls Suni Tomomitsu, one of the runners: "At first we thought, `Oh, wow, he's like Mafia man'.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="28" wdcount="10"> Then we said, `Oh no, this is nice Johnny Kelley'.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="29" wdcount="5"> In Japan, he is awesome".</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="30" wdcount="20"> Though he isn't the oldest person ever to enter the Boston Marathon, Mr. Kelley is the oldest to run it.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="31" wdcount="17"> Peter Foley, who was born in 1859, was a regular until he was well into his 80s.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="32" wdcount="5"> But he walked the course.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="33" wdcount="22"> Starting at dawn (six hours before the official noon start), Mr. Foley would eventually saunter across the finish line in the moonlight.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="34" wdcount="41"> Of course, Mr. Kelley -- not to be confused with the other John Kelley, who won the Boston Marathon in 1957 -- isn't the runner he was in 1935 when he won the race, in 2 hours, 32 minutes, 7 seconds.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="35" wdcount="13"> His best time ever was in 1945: 2 hours, 30 minutes, 40 seconds.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="36" wdcount="9"> Last year he finished in 5 hours, 5 minutes.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="37" wdcount="7"> He hopes to do better in 1991.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="38" wdcount="9"> "That's not a prediction, just a goal," he says.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="39" wdcount="32"> When John Kelley first toed the line in 1928, George Bush wasn't yet in kindergarten, Joe DiMaggio was an unknown and Nike was the winged goddess of victory, not a running shoe.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="40" wdcount="24"> In those days, Mr. Kelley recalls, he ran in black leather high-jumping shoes that he cut open at the toes with a razor blade.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="41" wdcount="18"> "I would have loved to run with the worst pair of sneakers on the market today," he says.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="42" wdcount="10"> Back then, the sport didn't have much of a following.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="43" wdcount="24"> Today, of course, the Boston Marathon is a big deal, covered by TV from start to finish and offering $402,000 altogether in prize money.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="44" wdcount="10"> "The winners get a medal and $55,000," says Mr. Kelley.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="45" wdcount="7"> "I got a medal and beef stew.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="46" wdcount="5"> God bless them," he adds.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="47" wdcount="3"> "They deserve it".</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="48" wdcount="9"> The rosy-cheeked, supple Mr. Kelley is a medical wonder.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="49" wdcount="19"> Each year, he visits the Cooper Clinic at the Aerobics Center in Dallas for a battery of endurance tests.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="50" wdcount="17"> "Physiologically, whatever that means, I got all A's," Mr. Kelley reports of his checkup four months ago.</s>
<s docid="WSJ910326-0090" num="51" wdcount="37"> "What that means," explains Kenneth Cooper, the physician who wrote "Aerobics" and several sequels and is now at work on a book on elderly athletes, "is that Johnny has the body of a man 23 years younger.</s>
