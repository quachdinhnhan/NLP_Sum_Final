<s docid="AP890923-0035" num="11" wdcount="20"> Hugo blasted the eastern Caribbean and the Carolinas with 135 mph winds this past week, killing at least 41 people.</s>

<s docid="AP890923-0035" num="15" wdcount="8"> It was the most powerful hurricane ever recorded.</s>
<s docid="AP890923-0035" num="16" wdcount="28"> Gilbert seems to be about the upper limit of a hurricane with current ocean temperatures, said Kerry Emanuel of the meteorology department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</s>
<s docid="AP890923-0035" num="17" wdcount="36"> But if the seas warm up, say by 3 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit, ``the wind speeds might be 25 percent higher _ which means the destructive force would be more like 50 percent higher,'' he said.</s>
<s docid="AP890923-0035" num="18" wdcount="23"> Stephen Schneider, deputy director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Denver, said his research suggests the warming trend is already here.</s>
<s docid="AP890923-0035" num="19" wdcount="30"> Schneider, an expert on the greenhouse effect and author of a new book ``Global Warming,'' said six of the 10 hottest years in the last 100 occurred in the 1980s.</s>
<s docid="AP890923-0035" num="20" wdcount="9"> He projects that the 1990s will be even hotter.</s>
<s docid="AP890923-0035" num="21" wdcount="32"> Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm Atlantic waters when its winds jumped from 105 mph to 135 mph as it passed over the Gulf Stream before hitting the East Coast, Schneider said.</s>
<s docid="AP890923-0035" num="22" wdcount="11"> ``You'll get worse hurricanes if the Caribbean is warmer,'' he said.</s>
<s docid="AP890923-0035" num="23" wdcount="13"> ``And I think there are better-than-even odds that you will have stronger hurricanes''.</s>
<s docid="AP890923-0035" num="24" wdcount="25"> Emanuel said if the ocean temperature climbs, moderate hurricanes of the future could grow to Gilbert's strength _ and future Gilberts will be even stronger.</s>
<s docid="AP890923-0035" num="25" wdcount="36"> Gilbert was so strong that Bob Sheets, director of the national hurricane center, said forecasters may have to use an intensity scale of 1-6 in the future, instead of the current 1-5, with five the highest.</s>
<s docid="AP890923-0035" num="26" wdcount="46"> The computer models Schneider uses show that in a worst-case scenario, over the next 100 years the world's temperature could jump by 10 degrees if carbon dioxide and methane gas _ which both contribute to the greenhouse effect _ continue to pour into the atmosphere unchecked.</s>
<s docid="AP890923-0035" num="27" wdcount="19"> It is possible that even though the world as a whole heats up, the Caribbean could somehow remain cooler.</s>
<s docid="AP890923-0035" num="28" wdcount="6"> But he said that is unlikley.</s>
<s docid="AP890923-0035" num="29" wdcount="9"> ``That's not what the models are showing,'' Schneider said.</s>
<s docid="AP890923-0035" num="30" wdcount="11"> ``And that's another reason I'd like to slow down global warming.''</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0054" num="10" wdcount="32"> Residents took forecasters at their word when they warned of Hurricane Hugo's fury, and the low number of deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy respect, authorities said.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0054" num="11" wdcount="30"> The storm, which caused billions in damage, claimed 17 lives in South Carolina, and only two were in the Charleston area, which bore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0054" num="12" wdcount="13"> ``We just feel very thankful about that,'' said Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0054" num="13" wdcount="26"> ``Several thousands of people who were in the shelters and the tens of thousands of people who evacuated inland were potential victims of injury and death''.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0054" num="14" wdcount="19"> Riley and other officials credited residents with monitoring the hurricane as it spun toward Charleston, and heeding evacuation warnings.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0054" num="15" wdcount="21"> The last big storm to hit South Carolina was Hurricane David in 1979, which hit the coast after pounding southern Florida.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0054" num="16" wdcount="20"> Since then several big storms have threatened but veered away, and officials were worried that Charlestonians wouldn't heed Hugo's warnings.</s>

<s docid="AP890925-0054" num="18" wdcount="9"> ``But this storm was very, very strong,'' he said.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0054" num="19" wdcount="5"> ``This time they realized it''.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0054" num="20" wdcount="20"> Glen Ellis, a Red Cross official, estimated that 18,000 residents in Charleston and the three surrounding counties headed for shelters.</s>

<s docid="LA092789-0093" num="21" wdcount="17"> The Insurance Information Institute is expected to issue a report Thursday on overall insured losses from Hugo.</s>
<s docid="LA092789-0093" num="22" wdcount="29"> Although the losses are substantial, they are not expected to threaten the financial health of any individual company because reinsurers will pick up a significant portion of the costs.</s>
