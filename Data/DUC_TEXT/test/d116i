<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="16" wdcount="36"> Engineers had said all along they believed the antennas were working all right and that the problem was in incorrectly pointing either the satellite or the TDRS, an orbiting communications satellite that acts as a switchboard.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="17" wdcount="27"> In the successful attempt, they nearly doubled the width of the antennas' beams to take in more territory, from a sweep of 6.2 degrees to 10.8 degrees.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="18" wdcount="23"> The telescope's low-gain antennas, which receive and transmit information at a much slower rate and can be used in emergencies, were working well.</s>

<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="23" wdcount="17"> It began between 1 and 1:30 a.m. EDT and lasted 45 minutes to an hour, he said.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="24" wdcount="23"> The second failure occurred at 6:44 a.m. when controllers attempted to send a signal to the telescope's two high-gain antennas through the TDRS.</s>

<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="26" wdcount="14"> ``It's a new spacecraft and we think inexperience dealing with it was the cause''.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="27" wdcount="31"> The telescope, embarking on a 15-year search for new worlds, was released from the shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday after a last-minute snag that almost sent two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk.</s>

<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="33" wdcount="12"> ``We appreciate the good words from everybody,'' replied Discovery Commander Loren Shriver.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="34" wdcount="35"> After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of maneuvers, the last one completed this morning, to ``park'' Discovery in orbit 46 miles behind Hubble.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="35" wdcount="22"> ``The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and we sure hope it does good work,'' Shriver said Wednesday.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="36" wdcount="18"> ``Well, it sure is now, Loren, and thanks for all the great work you've done,'' replied Mission Control.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="37" wdcount="6"> ``Galileo is real proud of you''.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="38" wdcount="31"> Scientists have hailed the Hubble _ NASA's most expensive unmanned spacecraft _ as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="39" wdcount="27"> Discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope while controllers at the Goddard center make sure Hubble is operating properly, such as responding to directional commands.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="40" wdcount="23"> The next milestone is Friday, when the telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight.</s>

<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="43" wdcount="23"> If the aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery could return to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalk to fix it.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="44" wdcount="23"> Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said the telescope would be tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door is opened.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="45" wdcount="25"> ``We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the Hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight,'' he said.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="46" wdcount="9"> Too much light could damage the telescope's sensitive instruments.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="47" wdcount="25"> On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12-ton telescope and hoist it from the cargo bay.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="48" wdcount="28"> One of the telescope's solar arrays unreeled from its mast as expected and started providing power to the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="49" wdcount="8"> But there was trouble with the second panel.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="50" wdcount="21"> It wouldn't budge when the latches were released, and then moved about a fifth of its 39-foot length and stopped again.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="51" wdcount="11"> The panel rolled all the way out on the third attempt.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="52" wdcount="33"> By the final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were in their space suits in the airlock, 30 minutes away from taking tools in hand and going on an outer-space maintenance call.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="53" wdcount="9"> Wojtalik said the cause of the problem is unknown.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="54" wdcount="18"> The 8-hour procedure was performed 380 miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="55" wdcount="15"> The orbit was dictated by the need to put Hubble above the Earth's distorting atmosphere.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="56" wdcount="32"> Astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the beginning of the time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken 14 billions years to reach Earth.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="57" wdcount="18"> They hope to determine how and when the universe was formed, currently estimated at 15 billion years ago.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="58" wdcount="19"> The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.</s>
<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="59" wdcount="18"> Discovery, which blasted into orbit Tuesday, is scheduled to land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif .</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0022" num="10" wdcount="33"> The shuttle that put the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit also carries an instrument used in the 1920s by astronomer Edwin Hubble: the eyepiece from what once was the world's most powerful telescope.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0022" num="11" wdcount="37"> ``It's a great pleasure to have something of such historical significance and something that so directly symbolizes Edwin Hubble's fundamental contributions to astronomy,'' astronaut Kathy Sullivan said Friday as she circled the Earth in space shuttle Discovery.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0022" num="12" wdcount="16"> The eyepiece from the Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch Hooker Telescope was carried into orbit by Sullivan.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0022" num="13" wdcount="17"> After she brings the eyepiece back to Earth, it will be placed on display at the observatory.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0022" num="14" wdcount="24"> ``It's basically a symbolic gesture from the past of astronomy to the future of astronomy,'' said Lyn McAfee, spokeswoman for the Mount Wilson Institute.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0022" num="15" wdcount="15"> The Pasadena-based group runs the observatory, located in the San Gabriel Mountains outside Los Angeles.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0022" num="16" wdcount="26"> ``The discoveries made by Hubble on the 100-inch telescope at Mount Wilson gave us a giant leap forward in our understanding of the universe,'' McAfee said.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0022" num="17" wdcount="11"> ``We believe the Hubble Space Telescope will do the same thing''.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0022" num="18" wdcount="33"> The Hooker Telescope was the world's most powerful telescope from its construction in 1918 until 1948, when the 200-inch Hale Telescope was placed in operation at Mount Palomar Observatory northeast of San Diego.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0022" num="19" wdcount="25"> Using the Hooker Telescope, Hubble was the first to determine the distance to a galaxy outside the Milky Way, the institute said in a statement.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0022" num="20" wdcount="24"> ``This crucial discovery provided the first definite proof that other galaxies existed far beyond the confines of our own local galaxy,'' the institute said.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0022" num="21" wdcount="34"> During the 1920s and 1930s, Hubble and an assistant used the Hooker telescope to take thousands of photographs of faint galaxies, showing that most of them were moving away from each other very quickly.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0022" num="22" wdcount="21"> ``This provided observational evidence for the concept, suggested by Einstein's Theory of Relativity, that the universe is expanding,'' the institute said.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0022" num="23" wdcount="23"> Hubble's work helped convince scientists the universe was created in a giant explosion, called the ``big bang,'' an estimated 15 billion years ago.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0022" num="24" wdcount="20"> The Hooker Telescope was mothballed in 1985 by the Carnegie Institution, former operator of the observatory, in a money-saving move.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0022" num="25" wdcount="10"> The institute hopes to obtain funds to reopen it .</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="11" wdcount="34"> The Hubble Space Telescope was awakened from its self-induced sleep today but it was still without the use of its high-speed antennas, and its science instruments were on hold, unable to begin any observations.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="12" wdcount="19"> ``We are out of the `safe-mode' right now,'' said Steve Terry, a supervisor of the engineers controlling the telescope.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="13" wdcount="22"> He said the telescope was running on a ``normal control-all mode,'' where its own computers and sensors guide where it is pointing.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="14" wdcount="26"> Discovery's astronauts, meanwhile, packed their gear for a return to Earth Sunday, made some last-minute observations of Earth and talked with ground-based reporters about their flight.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="15" wdcount="35"> Pilot Charles Bolden said he was especially upbeat about the widespread public awareness of the telescope, which is expected eventually to look back 14 billion light years _ nearly to the birth of the universe.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="16" wdcount="19"> ``It's hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard of the Hubble Space Telescope,'' said Bolden.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="17" wdcount="7"> ``It makes little kids' eyes light up.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="18" wdcount="15"> It makes little kids want to learn how to add and subtract and study science''.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="19" wdcount="33"> The telescope's big eye has remained open, but Hubble had been in a ``safe mode'' with all motion stopped because of earlier problems in linking the high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="20" wdcount="13"> The antennas are the primary links for relaying scientific data to the ground.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="21" wdcount="39"> Terry said that even in the safe mode, one of the tape recorders in the telescope reads telemetry signals from all its systems and that these would be played to Earth and analyzed when the antennas are working properly.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="22" wdcount="12"> ``We expect to use that data to investigate what happened,'' he said.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="23" wdcount="33"> Engineers are able to send commands to the telescope via its secondary antennas but the communications system is not useful for scientific data, which must be transmitted at a high rate of speed.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="24" wdcount="16"> ``We're putting the scientific instruments in a hold mode, in effect a standby mode,'' he said.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="25" wdcount="42"> Shortly after 6 a.m. EDT, controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., completed a series of commands that took the telescope out of its safe mode and then began to run a 12-hour computer program to monitor Hubble's health.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="26" wdcount="32"> It will take another day before the $1.5 billion telescope is operating the way it was supposed to at this point in the startup process, said Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="27" wdcount="18"> ``We're backing up to a very deliberate and slow and careful approach to these problems,'' Olivier said Friday.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="28" wdcount="9"> ``This is not the time to do anything dumb''.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="29" wdcount="26"> The telescope problems have put the flight center several days behind, but the five astronauts who deployed it earlier this week were sticking to their schedule.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="30" wdcount="25"> Landing is scheduled for 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., but flight controllers were keeping a close watch on the weather.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="31" wdcount="14"> Winds were predicted to be about 20 mph with gusts up to 29 mph.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="32" wdcount="11"> Mission rules dictate that headwinds cannot exceed 29 mph at touchdown.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="33" wdcount="17"> The shuttle carries enough supplies to stay in orbit three days beyond Sunday if necessary, NASA said.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="34" wdcount="17"> Mission Control awakened the crew members at about 1:30 a.m. EDT today by playing the song, ``Cosmos''.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="35" wdcount="14"> ``Thanks for the wake-up music, it's pretty appropriate for today,'' said Commander Loren Shriver.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="36" wdcount="22"> ``The song was selected in honor of Hubble Space Telescope, which is now open for business,'' said Mission Control commentator James Hartsfield.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="37" wdcount="17"> The astronauts were to finish up their experiments and photography today and pack for the trip home.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="38" wdcount="17"> They also planned to hold a news conference from space with reporters at the Johnson Space Center.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="39" wdcount="28"> Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden were to run through a series of tests to make certain the shuttle's computers and control jets were ready for return to Earth.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="40" wdcount="23"> The crew deployed Hubble on Wednesday but they had stayed close to the telescope in case there was trouble opening the aperture door.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="41" wdcount="25"> Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in orbit 380 miles above Earth.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="42" wdcount="24"> But that proved unnecessary when the door was opened Friday morning, exposing the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch eye to starlight for the first time.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="43" wdcount="20"> Two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working when the door opened, but engineers later got them back on line.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="44" wdcount="27"> The gyroscopes were knocked out by the motion and that, too, kept the telescope in the safe mode, said Dave Drachlis, director of orbital verifications at Goddard.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="45" wdcount="21"> A colleague, Steve Terry, said Hubble's systems were set at conservative limits for the first operations and that caused many malfunctions.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="46" wdcount="9"> There also were two communications outages totaling several hours.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="47" wdcount="31"> Hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be ``the master of its own destiny'' in case contact with an orbiting communications system is lost for extended periods, Terry said.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="48" wdcount="23"> NASA had planned to release its first test image from the telescope on Tuesday, showing an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="49" wdcount="12"> But Terry said that would be delayed because of the antenna problems.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="50" wdcount="9"> Scientific data will follow in a month or two.</s>
<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="51" wdcount="32"> The telescope, named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, will enable astronomers over its 15-year working lifetime to look back 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of the universe.</s>
