<s docid="FT922-1115" num="6" wdcount="50"> MR MICHAEL STONEY, a senior executive in a number of Maxwell companies, is named as one of three people primarily responsible for more than Pounds 180m of 'unusual' payments from Mirror Group Newspapers bank accounts during the last financial year, according to the chairman's statement released with MGN accounts yesterday.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1115" num="7" wdcount="26"> Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell, two sons of the late Robert Maxwell, are named as the other two people most involved in these transactions.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1115" num="8" wdcount="15"> Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Stoney refused to provide MGN with information, the statement says.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1115" num="9" wdcount="31"> Sir Robert Clark, chairman of MGN, lists a series of transactions - some of which he stresses may have been perfectly legitimate - that took place in the past few months.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1115" num="10" wdcount="40"> He says legal action may be taken against a number of organisations, including Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, over more than Pounds 40m in transfers from MGN if the bank was aware that they were 'effected for improper purposes'.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1115" num="11" wdcount="34"> Notes to the accounts show that MGN made extraordinary provisions of Pounds 421.5m in the year to December 29 1991, including Pounds 208.6m in pension deficiencies and Pounds 122.4m in transactions with Maxwell-controlled companies.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1115" num="12" wdcount="32"> Sir Robert says that during the year there were at least 28 'unusual' payments for more than Pounds 1m from the group's bank accounts, making a total of more than Pounds 180m.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1115" num="13" wdcount="12"> 'Some may well ultimately be established to have arisen under legitimate transactions'.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1115" num="14" wdcount="10"> Nine of the payments were authorised solely by Robert Maxwell.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1115" num="15" wdcount="18"> The others were authorised mainly by Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr Ian Maxwell and Mr Michael Stoney, he says.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1115" num="16" wdcount="28"> One transfer to Goldman Sachs was countersigned by Mr Ernest Burrington, former managing director, at the request of Mr Kevin Maxwell on the reported instruction of Robert Maxwell.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1115" num="17" wdcount="12"> Two authorisations were countersigned by Mr Lawrence Guest, former MGN finance director.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1115" num="18" wdcount="24"> Sir Robert says the MGN directors do not believe that either Mr Burrington or Mr Guest knew there was anything improper about these payments.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1115" num="19" wdcount="25"> With these exceptions, 'the independent directors . . . were not involved in, and did not authorise or approve any of these payments,' he says.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1115" num="20" wdcount="37"> Sir Robert says the group finance department accepted assurances from the treasury department - which was headed by Mr Stoney - about 'the nature of certain transactions' including payments to financial institutions which were recorded as deposits.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1115" num="21" wdcount="25"> 'The treasury department arranged for it to appear that sums of interest had been credited to the group in respect of those 'deposits',' he says.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1115" num="22" wdcount="97"> In his report Sir Robert points to 'certain weaknesses' accepted by the MGN board: Internal controls and operating procedures which failed to identify related party transactions and bring them to the attention of independent directors for approval; Bank mandates authorised by Robert Maxwell and Mr Stoney which permitted the movement of group funds on the authority of Maxwell or directors who were also directors of Maxwell-controlled companies; The audit committee of non-executive directors, which might have reviewed systems and mandates, but was not convened; The finance department's inadequate authority to verify and record the treasury department's activities.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1115" num="23" wdcount="79"> The report details a Pounds 50m loan made by Bankers Trust in London last October which appears to have been used to pay off a loan from Bankers Trust in New York to Robert Maxwell Group, parent of the Maxwell private interests, Separately, the statement highlights three transfers of more than Pounds 40m from MGN to Goldman Sachs - Pounds 11m of this was transferred on Robert Maxwell's signature to pay for previous dealings in Maxwell Communication Corporation stock.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1115" num="24" wdcount="19"> The balance was for foreign exchange trade exposures incurred by Bishopsgate Investment Trust and Robert Maxwell Group, it says.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1115" num="25" wdcount="30"> He says MGN is inquiring to see whether it can establish if Goldman Sachs was 'aware or should have been aware' that the transfers 'had been effected for improper purposes'.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1115" num="26" wdcount="20"> If so, he says 'it will be possible to seek orders against them . . . for the sums paid'.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1115" num="27" wdcount="31"> He says MGN is considering legal action against professional advisers in relation to property leases, and hopes to recover money through claims on insurance policies written on Robert Maxwell's life .</s>

<s docid="FT922-2972" num="6" wdcount="26"> ABOUT 20 banks became con-cerned last summer at the behaviour of businesses run by Robert Maxwell several months before he died and his business empire collapsed.</s>
<s docid="FT922-2972" num="7" wdcount="18"> Their concern arose when Maxwell Communication Corporation made late payments to them, a Financial Times investigation has discovered.</s>
<s docid="FT922-2972" num="8" wdcount="34"> Yet although some banks became alarmed at the implications for the financial health of his empire, they did not discuss their concerns with each other or with authorities such as the Bank of England.</s>
<s docid="FT922-2972" num="9" wdcount="33"> Mr Basil Brookes, MCC's former finance director, has described his shock to the FT at discovering last August that MCC had failed to settle foreign currency transactions with about 20 banks on time.</s>
<s docid="FT922-2972" num="10" wdcount="27"> Starting about July 4 1991, MCC's treasury, under the authority of Maxwell and his son, Kevin, had begun to buy and sell enormous amounts of foreign currencies.</s>
<s docid="FT922-2972" num="11" wdcount="20"> In these 'spot' transactions, MCC would buy a currency in one financial centre promising to make payment in another centre.</s>
<s docid="FT922-2972" num="12" wdcount="22"> On a number of occasions, MCC received the currency, but did not make the payment - thereby giving itself an unauthorised loan.</s>
<s docid="FT922-2972" num="13" wdcount="26"> Mr Brookes says about 20 banks, including Lloyds, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Swiss Bank Corporation, were involved in the flurry of foreign exchange deals.</s>
<s docid="FT922-2972" num="14" wdcount="17"> At least Dollars 100m (Pounds 55m) in unapproved credit is thought to have been raised this way.</s>
<s docid="FT922-2972" num="15" wdcount="15"> A former Maxwell employee said some appeared to have been channelled into private Maxwell businesses.</s>
<s docid="FT922-2972" num="16" wdcount="27"> One banker said attempts to raise money by making late payments in the foreign market was a relatively well-known ruse with the nickname called 'teaming and lading'.</s>
<s docid="FT922-2972" num="17" wdcount="35"> It also emerged yesterday that National Westminster Bank, the biggest lender to the Maxwell private companies, felt badly let down by Maxwell because he failed to deliver funds on time at the end of July.</s>
<s docid="FT922-2972" num="18" wdcount="25"> At a meeting between Maxwell and Mr John Melbourn, a NatWest director, on July 10, NatWest refused Maxwell's request for a loan of Pounds 45m.</s>
<s docid="FT922-2972" num="19" wdcount="39"> NatWest was upset three weeks later when it provided funds - less than Pounds 100m - to the Maxwell empire on the understanding that it would be repaid the same day, and then found that repayment was not made.</s>
<s docid="FT922-2972" num="20" wdcount="16"> NatWest was forced to convert this 'intra-day' transaction into a short-term loan, which was eventually repaid.</s>
<s docid="FT922-2972" num="21" wdcount="36"> The bank told both Robert Maxwell and Mr Kevin Maxwell that it was concerned that repayment had not been made, but it did not discuss the problem with other banks or with the Bank of England.</s>
<s docid="FT922-2972" num="22" wdcount="18"> Instead, it pressed on with its policy of reducing the size of its loans to the Maxwell businesses.</s>
<s docid="FT922-2972" num="23" wdcount="17"> NatWest's loans to the Maxwell empire now total Pounds 182m, half the level of two years ago.</s>
<s docid="FT922-2972" num="24" wdcount="39"> Later last year, Robert Maxwell made many repayments to banks by looting pension fund assets and also carrying out unusual fundraising exercises with US investment banks, from which tens of millions of dollars were borrowed at a high price.</s>

<s docid="FT922-3446" num="6" wdcount="41"> DOCUMENTS which show for the first time that both Mr Robert Maxwell and his son Kevin were intimately involved in substantial purchases of shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation, one of their own public companies, have been obtained by the Financial Times.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="7" wdcount="47"> Meanwhile, a director of a secretive Swiss trust, Mr Werner Rechsteiner, has broken his silence and has admitted that transfers of MCC shares to his trust, which are at the centre of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, were made on the instructions of Robert Maxwell.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="8" wdcount="24"> This is the first time that Mr Rechsteiner has given details of the relationship between his mysterious trust, Yakosa Finanzierungs, and the Maxwell family.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="9" wdcount="40"> The FT has also obtained a letter and has seen a corroborating fax which shows that Mr Kevin Maxwell was intimately involved in the purchase of 9m shares by Yakosa and a further 16m shares by Servex, another Swiss Trust.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="10" wdcount="27"> The MCC purchases by Yakosa and Servex are the object of an investigation by the SFO into an alleged illegal scheme to support the MCC share price.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="11" wdcount="30"> The SFO is also investigating whether Mr Robert Maxwell or Mr Kevin Maxwell breached the Companies Act by failing to disclose the purchases of the shares by the Swiss trusts.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="12" wdcount="26"> If either had a financial interest in the Swiss trusts, the purchases should have been disclosed under company law, because they were both directors of MCC.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="13" wdcount="35"> The documents demonstrate that Bishopsgate Investment Trust, a private UK company controlled by the Maxwell family, provided Pounds 55.33m on behalf of the two Swiss trusts so that they could pay for the MCC shares.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="14" wdcount="12"> Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, acted as broker to the deals.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="15" wdcount="8"> Goldman's lawyers are convinced that it acted properly.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="16" wdcount="25"> Mr Rechsteiner yesterday broke the silence he has maintained since Robert Maxwell's death in November on the subject of his relationship with the Maxwell family.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="17" wdcount="14"> He said MCC share purchases had been 'going on for some time' through Yakosa.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="18" wdcount="11"> He denied that the shares were bought for Yakosa's 'own account'.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="19" wdcount="16"> He said the shares were bought for other 'foundations' and then 'held for a certain time'.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="20" wdcount="31"> He also stressed that ownership of the MCC shares no longer rested with Robert Maxwell once they had been received by Yakosa: 'Yakosa is owned by the Maxwell Foundation,' he said.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="21" wdcount="24"> Mr Rechsteiner refused to say who controlled the Maxwell Foundation, which is based in Liechtenstein, but said it was neither Robert nor Kevin Maxwell.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="22" wdcount="32"> The FT has however obtained documents showing that Mr Kevin Maxwell was closely involved in the process of paying for 25m MCC shares on behalf of two Swiss trusts, Yakosa and Servex.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="23" wdcount="48"> On May 29 last year, Mr Kevin Maxwell sent a fax to Mr Larry Wood, an executive director of Goldman Sachs, telling him that two parcels of 12.5m MCC shares each would be bought by the Swiss trusts with Pounds 55.33m provided by BIT, a Maxwell private company.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="24" wdcount="31"> The fax, signed by Mr Maxwell, said that the funds would be remitted to Goldman Sachs 'by Bishopsgate Investment Trust PLC from its account at National Westminter Bank plc, 41 Lothbury'.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="25" wdcount="35"> Two other faxes sent by Mr Kevin Maxwell to Mr Wood on the same day show that the former was equally involved in the other end of the transaction, the sale of the 25m shares.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="26" wdcount="29"> The Swiss trusts bought the shares, using Goldman as broker, from two Maxwell pension funds, Maxwell Communication Pension Trustee (Works Scheme) and Mirror Group Newspaper Pension Trustee (Works Scheme).</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="27" wdcount="18"> Each pension fund sold 12.5m shares at a price of 219.78p a share, or Pounds 27.47m in total.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="28" wdcount="22"> At 6.29pm on May 29, Mr Maxwell sent the two other faxes to Mr Wood on behalf of the two pension funds.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="29" wdcount="41"> As a director of MGPT and as a trustee of MCCPT, he told Mr Wood to pay each pension fund what it was owed to the NatWest account of BIT, which Mr Maxwell described as 'nominee' for the two pension funds.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="30" wdcount="35"> In other words, he told Mr Wood that the shares were being bought for the Swiss trusts with funds provided by BIT and that these funds should then be sent by Goldman back to BIT.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="31" wdcount="19"> In the event, on May 31, Goldman received the Pounds 55.3m by wire transfer in its account at Barclays.</s>
<s docid="FT922-3446" num="32" wdcount="22"> Goldman then levied its commission and expenses on the deal of Pounds 385,000 and wired the remainder back to BIT's NatWest account.</s>

<s docid="FT942-12054" num="6" wdcount="37"> Two writs have been filed alleging that Goldman Sachs, the US-based investment bank, assisted in diverting Pounds 55m from two pension schemes controlled by Robert Maxwell to ensure its own debts from Maxwell interests would be repaid.</s>
<s docid="FT942-12054" num="7" wdcount="29"> The writs were filed late last week in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan by trustees for Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Scheme and Maxwell Communication Corpora-tion Works Pension Scheme.</s>
<s docid="FT942-12054" num="8" wdcount="32"> The trustees seek more than Dollars 100m for the sale of shares plus interest, commission charges and punitive damages from Goldman and Mr Eric Sheinberg, partner in charge of international equities trading.</s>
<s docid="FT942-12054" num="9" wdcount="36"> The writs centre on the purchase of Pounds 55m of MCC shares from the pension schemes by two Swiss trusts, Servex and Yakosa, which were transacted through Goldman and for which the schemes were never paid.</s>
<s docid="FT942-12054" num="10" wdcount="13"> The writs allege Goldman was aware the trusts were controlled by Robert Maxwell.</s>
<s docid="FT942-12054" num="11" wdcount="53"> The writs also allege that on May 28 1991 - the same date Mr Kevin Maxwell arranged for the pension fund share transaction to be paid for - Goldman was due to receive Dollars 58.2m for an unrelated transaction selling MCC stock to an unnamed American lawyer 'with close connections to Robert Maxwell'.</s>
<s docid="FT942-12054" num="12" wdcount="17"> The writs claim that Goldman was 'competing directly with its customer, the pension fund trustee, for payment'.</s>
<s docid="FT942-12054" num="13" wdcount="22"> On April 26 1991, they say, Mr Kevin Maxwell told Mr Sheinberg to sell the pension scheme shares to the Swiss trusts.</s>
<s docid="FT942-12054" num="14" wdcount="36"> On May 23 he told Goldman to remit the proceeds of the sale not to the pension schemes but to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, which Goldman knew or should have known was controlled by the Maxwell family.</s>
<s docid="FT942-12054" num="15" wdcount="43"> The writs allege that after the deal was struck Mr Trevor Cook, MGN pension fund administrator, told Goldman that proceeds of the sale should be paid to the pension scheme, but when Mr Kevin Maxwell ordered the proceeds to be paid to BIT.</s>
<s docid="FT942-12054" num="16" wdcount="46"> The writs say that Goldman and Sheinberg 'made no reasonable effort to determine who had actual authority to direct for the pension fund that the shares be sold and where the more than Dollars 47m in proceeds from the transfer of the 12.5m shares should go'.</s>
<s docid="FT942-12054" num="17" wdcount="42"> Goldman said it had 'received no money or other benefit from these transactions other than its brokerage commissions of Pounds 110,000 which were substantially less than the amount of the applicable stamp duties paid to the Inland Revenue of Pounds 215,000' .</s>
