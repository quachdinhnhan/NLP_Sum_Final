<s docid="AP901016-0112" num="13" wdcount="29"> ``There was very strong individual support for several books on the short list and finally `Possession' by A.S. Byatt was the winner by a majority vote,'' said the judges.</s>
<s docid="AP901016-0112" num="14" wdcount="28"> ``The panel was unanimous, however, in agreeing that the standard of the other five novels was exceptionally high and this made their decision unusually interesting and unusually difficult''.</s>
<s docid="AP901016-0112" num="15" wdcount="26"> Ms. Byatt, who earlier this month won the $43,000 Irish Times-Aer Lingus prize for international fiction for the same work, has published five novels since 1964.</s>
<s docid="AP901016-0112" num="16" wdcount="35"> In ``Possession,'' she tells how two graduate students piece together the relationship and lives of two imaginary Victorian poets from fragments of their letters and by retracing the poets' journeys across England and to France.</s>
<s docid="AP901016-0112" num="17" wdcount="14"> The influence of the past on the living is a theme throughout the book.</s>

<s docid="FT923-3822" num="9" wdcount="33"> Its critics say that the autumn brouhaha distorts the annual fiction industry and the intense media hype of the shortlisted authors does a disservice to the hordes of other gifted but unlisted writers.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3897" num="9" wdcount="52"> They have avoided dull and worthy classics and chosen six books which stirred the fin de siecle world and remain compelling today: George du Maurier's Trilby, Anthony Hope's The Prisoner of Zenda, George Moore's Esther Waters, Kipling's Jungle Book, George Gissing's In the Year of Jubilee and RL Stevenson's The Ebb Tide.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="10" wdcount="22"> The winner will be revealed on October 15 (four days after the 1994 Booker Prize ceremony) at the Cheltenham Festival of Literature.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="11" wdcount="24"> Like today's Booker Prize, it is a publishing gimmick; Everyman, which is backing the spoof award, is a significant publisher of classic Victorian novels.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="12" wdcount="12"> But the retrospective Booker is also a fascinating exercise in historical reconstruction.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="13" wdcount="18"> It raises questions about how the relationship between literature and society has changed in the past 100 years.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="14" wdcount="3"> First, the similarities.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="15" wdcount="7"> A good yarn is a good yarn.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="16" wdcount="37"> Of the 1894 books, Trilby is the tale of a tone-deaf model who sings like an angel when mesmerised by the sinister hypnotist Svengali, then croaks like a crow when he dies during one of her concerts.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="17" wdcount="18"> The Prisoner of Zenda tells of an Englishman impersonating the King of Ruritania and rescuing him from demons.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="18" wdcount="29"> On the 1994 list Romesh Guneskera's Reef is about a Sri Lankan servant boy and his mysterious master, while Jill Paton Walsh's Knowledge of Angels re-enacts the wolf-child legend.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3897" num="23" wdcount="36"> The controversial books of 1894 were Trilby, with its louche vie boheme milieu, and Esther Waters, in which a 17-year-old girl is seduced, impregnated and offered the services of a professional baby killer for a fiver.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="24" wdcount="26"> It is now seen as Moore's best work, but in 1894 it had problems finding a publisher and the powerful circulating libraries refused to take it.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3897" num="27" wdcount="30"> But even if Hollinghurst wins the Booker, his novel will not become the succes de scandale of Esther Waters and Trilby, which became the bestselling novel of the 19th century.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="28" wdcount="21"> For the great difference between then and now is that in 1894 a Booker Prize was not needed to sell fiction.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3897" num="33" wdcount="9"> The Victorians, in contrast, were lovers of contemporary fiction.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="34" wdcount="19"> Novels accounted for 20 per cent of published books, and no distinction was made between high and low art.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="35" wdcount="19"> In the mid 19th century, Dickens made Pounds 12,000 for Little Dorrit, the equivalent of nearly Pounds 400,000 today.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="36" wdcount="29"> Between 1861 and 1894, when the population of the UK was half that of today and the literate population smaller still, Mrs Henry Wood's East Lynne sold 400,000 copies.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="37" wdcount="24"> All the 1894 Booker writers were popular names; they were also serious, skilful writers whose books can be reread with pleasure 100 years later.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="38" wdcount="12"> Why was fiction so much closer to the public heart in 1894?</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="39" wdcount="8"> Social, cultural and psychological reasons play a part.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="40" wdcount="39"> Socially, the 1890s reading public was a vastly more homogenous group than today: a small number of middle class authors wrote for a middle class audience at a time when to be literate was to belong to an elite.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="41" wdcount="11"> The idea of a two-tier, up and down-market, fiction was irrelevant.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="42" wdcount="22"> Culturally, these writers and readers were certain of their place in the mainstream, and the novel was their political and intellectual forum.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="43" wdcount="18"> Today we no longer share the Victorian confidence in the novel as a key genre of our age.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="44" wdcount="26"> Modernism and the overturning of the traditional form by Joyce and Woolf weakened 20th-century belief in the novel and encouraged the divergence between highbrow and lowbrow.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="45" wdcount="23"> The dominance of film and television has made novels a more marginal form and perhaps they no longer attract the most creative talents.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="46" wdcount="20"> George du Maurier originally offered the outline of Trilby to Henry James, who he thought would write a better novel.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="47" wdcount="12"> Today du Maurier would have sold it to Hollywood or the BBC.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="48" wdcount="33"> The fantasy element of fiction, in which we identify with characters as if we know them, was answered in the 19th century by the novel; in the 20th century we have TV soaps.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="49" wdcount="42"> Just as the tabloid newspapers feature characters from EastEnders, so when Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop was running as a serial there was widespread press speculation on whether Little Nell would die, and readers wrote in begging for her to be saved.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="50" wdcount="16"> Sentimentality, accessibility, topicality - what characterises today's soaps were clear features of the novel in 1894.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="51" wdcount="32"> Both In the Year of Jubilee and Esther Waters, for example, centre on the burning 1890s debate about marriage, feminism and the 'New Woman', yet both are also tearjerkers which everyone enjoyed.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="52" wdcount="18"> The 1894 books are compelling because they prefigure our own times and yet are set back from them.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="53" wdcount="32"> Trilby is a tale of hypnotism and the unconscious a decade away from Freud; The Ebb Tide paved the way for Conrad's Heart of Darkness and the first questioning of colonial oppression.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="54" wdcount="16"> It is unlikely that the 1994 Booker choices will speak as eloquently of new trends today.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="55" wdcount="29"> Whereas the 1894 titles had contemporary settings, many of the 1994 books are historical (such as Paradise) or are driven by nostalgia (such as Beside the Ocean of Time).</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="56" wdcount="26"> Which book will win on October 15? Stevenson will get the sympathy vote because he died in 1894 in Samoa, the setting of The Ebb Tide.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="57" wdcount="50"> Jungle Book will get the retrospective vote, because it is the best-known today and has fashionable mythic overtones in the lost paradise of Mowgli's jungle; its position on the list may also rescue it from schmaltzy Disney associations and confirm it as a serious novel about a young man's self-discovery.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="58" wdcount="5"> My vote goes to Trilby.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="59" wdcount="37"> Soft-focus, ideologically shaky - in its anti-Semitic portrait of Svengali - and sometimes sloppy, it is a story of demonic possession and haunts the imagination like a fairy tale long after better-written works have faded from memory.</s>
<s docid="FT943-3897" num="60" wdcount="32"> Like Rebecca, the popular novel by du Maurier's granddaughter, it is a natural equivalent of what the current Booker Prize seeks to create: a combination of the classic and the bestseller .</s>

<s docid="FT943-5106" num="6" wdcount="25"> The shortlist of six for the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction, announced yesterday, immediately prompted the question 'Who'? from many in the publishing industry.</s>
<s docid="FT943-5106" num="7" wdcount="13"> According to one insider, some on the list 'are B-team writers at best'.</s>
<s docid="FT943-5106" num="8" wdcount="64"> The six include Alan Hollinghurst's The Folding Star (published by Chatto and Windus), a melancholy study of homosexual obsession which was tipped as a likely candidate from the initial 'long list' of 15, The Reef (Granta) by young Sri Lankan writer Romesh Gunesekera and How Late It Was, How Late (Secker and Warburg) by gritty Glasgow realist James Kelman, which was almost universally well-reviewed.</s>
<s docid="FT943-5106" num="9" wdcount="50"> As for the other three - Knowledge of Angels (Green Bay) a philosophical fable by children's author Jill Paton Walsh, Paradise (Hamish Hamilton) by Zanzibar-born writer Abdulrazak Gurnah and Beside the Ocean of Time (John Murray) by 72-year-old Orcadian poet George Mackay Brown - 'frankly, they don't make the grade'.</s>
<s docid="FT943-5106" num="10" wdcount="43"> The shortlist for the Booker, the UK's most hyped literary prize and one of the most lucrative, is all the more surprising in a bumper year for new fiction fulfilling the criteria - English language and non-American - for consideration for the award.</s>
<s docid="FT943-5106" num="11" wdcount="25"> Margaret Atwood's The Robber Bride seems an astonishing omission, as do new novels by Peter Ackroyd, Peter Carey, Candia McWilliam, William Trevor and Jim Crace.</s>
<s docid="FT943-5106" num="12" wdcount="26"> But if the shortlist of the final six candidates for the prize may be disappointing, the traditional controversy surrounding the award is as rife as ever.</s>
<s docid="FT943-5106" num="13" wdcount="50"> One unsurprising omission from the final selection was When The World Was Steady, a first novel by Claire Messud, which was on the 'long list' before it was pointed out that the author was the wife of James Wood, chief literary reviewer of The Guardian newspaper and a Booker judge.</s>
<s docid="FT943-5106" num="14" wdcount="31"> Professor John Bayley, chairman of the Booker panel and husband of former Booker Prize winner Dame Iris Murdoch, expressed surprise at Mr Wood's failure to reveal his relationship with Ms Messud.</s>
<s docid="FT943-5106" num="15" wdcount="18"> But it is the final list, rather than the controversy, that discredits the award according to some critics.</s>
<s docid="FT943-5106" num="16" wdcount="17"> 'This list,' said one man of letters, 'must have dealt a final death blow to the Booker'.</s>
<s docid="FT943-5106" num="17" wdcount="14"> The winner, selected from an original 130, will be announced on October 11 .</s>

<s docid="FT944-16774" num="6" wdcount="42"> After hours of heated delib-eration - under a system described as 'mad' by one judge - the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction last night went to Mr James Kelman for How Late It Was, How Late, published by Secker and Warburg.</s>
<s docid="FT944-16774" num="7" wdcount="41"> The novel, a story of Scottish low-life narrated largely in Glaswegian dialect, is unlikely to prove a popular choice with booksellers, who have damned all six books shortlisted for the prize as boring, elitist and - worst of all - unsaleable.</s>
<s docid="FT944-16774" num="8" wdcount="19"> Professor John Bayley, chairman of the Booker judges, acknowledged that Mr Kelman's book in particular might be deemed inaccessible.</s>
<s docid="FT944-16774" num="9" wdcount="18"> 'We had an extremely difficult final meeting and were very divided,' he said after three hours of debate.</s>
<s docid="FT944-16774" num="10" wdcount="19"> Rabbi Julia Neuberger, the only woman on the judging panel, said she was made extremely cross by the decision.</s>

<s docid="FT944-16774" num="16" wdcount="17"> Mr Kelman's book is, according to some observers, the most difficult work to have won the prize.</s>
<s docid="FT944-16774" num="17" wdcount="28"> In his acceptance speech, Mr Kelman, perceived by some as a Scottish isolationist, anticipated the criticism, by declaring: 'My culture and my language have the right to exist'.</s>
<s docid="FT944-16774" num="18" wdcount="35"> One guest at the prize-giving dinner at London's Guildhall, Mr Salman Rushdie, who won the prize in 1981 with Midnight's Children, remarked: 'James Kelman is good, but not as good as he thinks he is'.</s>
<s docid="FT944-16774" num="19" wdcount="11"> The Booker prize has, in its 26-year history, always provoked controversy.</s>
<s docid="FT944-16774" num="20" wdcount="11"> But this year's rows have been of a particularly fine vintage.</s>
<s docid="FT944-16774" num="21" wdcount="12"> Prof Bayley went on record with a rousing condemnation of contemporary fiction.</s>
<s docid="FT944-16774" num="22" wdcount="34"> Another judge, Mr James Wood, literary critic of The Guardian, was attacked for failing to reveal that a young novelist being considered for the award, Ms Claire Messud, was in fact Mrs James Wood.</s>
<s docid="FT944-16774" num="23" wdcount="16"> Most damaging of all was the verdict of the booksellers, who dismissed the shortlist as narcoleptic.</s>
<s docid="FT944-16774" num="24" wdcount="35"> The other contenders were The Folding Star by Alan Hollinghurst, Beside the Ocean of Time by George Mackay Brown, Paradise by Abdulrazak Gurnah, Reef by Romesh Gunesekera and Knowledge of Angels by Jill Paton Walsh.</s>
<s docid="FT944-16774" num="25" wdcount="19"> In spite of heavy publicity, the novels nominated have been selling 50 per cent less than last year's shortlist.</s>

<s docid="WSJ871110-0154" num="11" wdcount="39"> And for the last few weeks, literary punters throughout the British Isles have been placing bets on which of those writers would win the Booker Prize, the best-known, best-liked and, almost incidentally, most prestigious fiction award in the land.</s>
<s docid="WSJ871110-0154" num="12" wdcount="19"> In recent weeks the Booker contenders have received almost as much press coverage as the Charles and Di rift.</s>

<s docid="WSJ871110-0154" num="14" wdcount="24"> The betting is done largely by literary insiders, says Graham Sharpe, who sets the Booker odds at William Hill, Britain's other big betting agency.</s>

<s docid="WSJ871110-0154" num="43" wdcount="23"> Another notable spinoff is the Booker harpies, readers intent on digesting all six titles, then vigorously disputing the choices, which never please everyone.</s>
<s docid="WSJ871110-0154" num="44" wdcount="28"> This year the Sunday Times offered readers a complete autographed collection of the six books for the equivalent of $112, perfect fodder for the literary cocktail party cot.</s>
