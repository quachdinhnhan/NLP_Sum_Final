<s docid="FT931-2858" num="8" wdcount="30"> It has had to compromise - trading has been restricted to an hour a day, and dealing has moved back to the traditional ring, where it stopped a year ago.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2858" num="9" wdcount="17"> Dealers seemed to like this, the BSE index rising by 5.6 per cent on Monday and Tuesday.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2858" num="10" wdcount="23"> But another bomb blast in Calcutta triggered nervous selling yesterday, and the index came back by 50.62, or 2.1 per cent, to 2,409.23.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2858" num="11" wdcount="44"> All this has taken place against a volatile background: the Bombay equity market, over the past six weeks or so, has had to contend first with unusually bullish speculation, before the national budget on February 27, and subsequently with some savage expressions of disappointment.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2858" num="12" wdcount="18"> Dr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, disappointed traders in the budget at the end of last month.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2858" num="13" wdcount="19"> He postponed corporate tax reforms by a year, denying hopes of a tax cut recommended by an expert group.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2858" num="14" wdcount="28"> He did reduce excise and import duties on a broad front, but left out the cement and steel sectors, where share prices had been boosted by pre-budget speculation.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2858" num="15" wdcount="20"> To top it all, Dr Singh refused to equate domestic investors with their overseas counterparts in taxing short-term capital gains.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2858" num="16" wdcount="28"> He lowered the tax to 30 per cent from 65 per cent for expatriate Indians and foreign investors but for local investors it remained at 44.5 per cent.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2858" num="17" wdcount="19"> Taking the tax concessions for granted, traders had driven up share prices in February to make a kill later.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2858" num="18" wdcount="9"> Instead, the budget turned out to be a nightmare.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2858" num="19" wdcount="38"> While industry and business welcomed the statement which, for once, did not propose any new tax, Professor Rusi Taraporewala, the stock market theorist and academic, said a reduction in import duties would leave corporate profits ex-growth this year.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2858" num="20" wdcount="30"> The relative lack of financial concessions meant that disappointed traders sold with a vengeance and, until the weekend, the market seemed bottomless as equity prices plummeted to a 13-month low.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2858" num="21" wdcount="38"> Overseas investors fuelled the downtrend as they sold some half a million shares of Reliance Industries, arbitraging between the share price on the Bombay stock exchange and the market price of its Euro-issue of global depository receipts (GDRs).</s>
<s docid="FT931-2858" num="22" wdcount="20"> The opportunity arose after a change in Indian regulations which allows international investors to convert GDRs into the underlying stock.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2858" num="23" wdcount="23"> At the current conversion rate of Rs31 per US dollar, the Reliance GDR fetched Rs170 per share against the BSE quotation of Rs210.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2858" num="24" wdcount="24"> The BSE 30-share index plunged by more than one-fifth to 2,287 on March 10, from 2,893 at the post-budget trading session on February 27.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2858" num="25" wdcount="27"> Share prices rebounded last week, taking the index to 2,361 and the uptrend, on balance, has continued this week in spite of the bomb blast on Friday.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2858" num="26" wdcount="22"> Whether or not the surge will turn into a strong rally will depend on the ability of bulls to maintain their momentum.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2858" num="27" wdcount="31"> They are hoping that foreign portfolio investment will pick up with the restoration of trading after 'Black Friday', and the successful sale of Reliance stock on the BSE by international investors.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2858" num="28" wdcount="32"> The Indian stock markets have been passing through a series of crises since December, when activists of the Bhartiya Janta party pulled down the Babri mosque at Ayodhya, sparking off communal riots.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2858" num="29" wdcount="14"> Mr Mark Bulloch of Jardine Fleming takes the domestic political situation in his stride.</s>

<s docid="FT931-2858" num="33" wdcount="34"> In this, they are more fortunate than they were in previous years, when they were under pressure to take advantage of a long-term capital gains tax exemption before the financial year ended in March.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2858" num="34" wdcount="27"> The exemption has been replaced by a flat 20 per cent tax this year which, according to dealers, puts bulls and bears on an even footing .</s>

<s docid="FT931-2981" num="7" wdcount="33"> Police said a bomb exploded in the crowded trade and residential district of Bowbazaar shortly after midnight, causing two blocks of flats to collapse and trapping up to 70 people in the rubble.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2981" num="8" wdcount="42"> The identity of the bombers was unknown but the explosion comes just five days after over 250 people were killed and at least 1,200 injured in a series of bomb attacks aimed at the heart of the Indian business capital of Bombay.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2981" num="9" wdcount="38"> A militant Sikh group fighting for independence for the Indian state of Punjab has claimed responsibility for the Bombay blasts, but police are unconvinced, saying they were carried out by a foreign group in connivance with 'local criminals'.</s>

<s docid="FT931-3664" num="11" wdcount="20"> They sensed there was an enormous difference from the riots which scarred the city in December and again in January.</s>
<s docid="FT931-3664" num="12" wdcount="24"> Those were caused by a traditional mix of crime, political agitation and ancient Hindu-Moslem hatreds stirred by the destruction of the mosque in Ayodhya.</s>
<s docid="FT931-3664" num="13" wdcount="12"> The weapons used were mostly primitive - knives, clubs and petrol bottles.</s>
<s docid="FT931-3664" num="14" wdcount="22"> Friday's outrage, by contrast, bears the deadly stamp of high-technology terrorism, complete with Semtex plastic explosive, high-grade timers, efficient organisation and money.</s>
<s docid="FT931-3664" num="15" wdcount="24"> The only comparable previous incident was the assassination in 1991 of Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the former prime minister, by Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger terrorists.</s>
<s docid="FT931-3664" num="16" wdcount="23"> But that was a single bomb aimed at one man - the explosions in Bombay were designed to terrorise the nation's commercial capital.</s>
<s docid="FT931-3664" num="17" wdcount="9"> Bombay accounts for 35 per cent of India's exports.</s>
<s docid="FT931-3664" num="18" wdcount="17"> Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, described the blasts as an attack on India's economy.</s>
<s docid="FT931-3664" num="19" wdcount="26"> The immediate assumption both at the highest level and in the streets of Bombay was that those responsible must have been foreigners or had foreign help.</s>
<s docid="FT931-3664" num="20" wdcount="54"> But these suggestions were seen in Bombay as a deliberate attempt to deflect attention from the people who in the popular mind are the real suspects - Moslem extremists who might have taken revenge for the riots which hit India after the Ayodhya mosque's destruction and which left 2,000 dead, including 700 in Bombay.</s>
<s docid="FT931-3664" num="21" wdcount="26"> If Moslems are found to have staged the attacks, the Indian authorities will certainly suspect that the operation was supported from a Moslem country, notably Pakistan.</s>

<s docid="FT931-3664" num="27" wdcount="21"> Even if Moslem groups are found to be responsible for the bombings, they could have been supplied from other Moslem countries.</s>
<s docid="FT931-3664" num="28" wdcount="13"> India would still face a diplomatic crisis but hardly on the same scale.</s>
<s docid="FT931-3664" num="29" wdcount="18"> For the moment, such concerns seem remote from the streets on Bombay, where the atmosphere yesterday was calm.</s>
<s docid="FT931-3664" num="30" wdcount="15"> Workmen were clearing away rubble at the blast sites, including the blackened stock exchange building.</s>
<s docid="FT931-3664" num="31" wdcount="9"> Bombayites seemed determined to put the outrage behind them.</s>
<s docid="FT931-3664" num="32" wdcount="23"> At the Gymkhana Club and dozens of other sports grounds, hundreds of men and boys were playing cricket as they do every Sunday.</s>

<s docid="FT931-3664" num="34" wdcount="27"> The stock exchange authorities plan to re-start trading as soon as they can -probably today - using an old trading floor the exchange vacated only last year.</s>

<s docid="FT931-3664" num="37" wdcount="27"> Some of the credit for the limited disruption should go the government and the police for promptly calling paramilitary and regular troops to help patrol sensitive districts.</s>
<s docid="FT931-3664" num="38" wdcount="27"> But much more should go to the people of Bombay, who, so far at least, have refused to be goaded into violent protest by the bombers .</s>
