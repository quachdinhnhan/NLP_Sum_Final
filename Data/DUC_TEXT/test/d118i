<s docid="AP890105-0224" num="10" wdcount="32"> Tower, 63, a U.S. senator from Texas for 24 years, was admitted to Baylor University Medical Center on Wednesday after undergoing a colonscopy examination last week that revealed the polyp, Habgood said.</s>
<s docid="AP890105-0224" num="11" wdcount="23"> A preliminary biopsy of the polyp showed it was benign, Habgood said, but further results would be announced Friday by Tower's surgeon, Dr.</s>

<s docid="AP890105-0224" num="14" wdcount="14"> When Tower underwent the colonscopy examination, a rectal polyp also was discovered and removed.</s>
<s docid="AP890105-0224" num="15" wdcount="16"> Tests of that growth showed it to contain some ``malignant but well differentiated cells,'' Habgood said.</s>
<s docid="AP890105-0224" num="16" wdcount="24"> Further explanation of the first polyp removal would have to come from Tower's surgeon, who was unavailable for comment Thursday night, the spokesman said.</s>

<s docid="AP890211-0110" num="13" wdcount="31"> Tower, who has declined to be interviewed while his nomination is pending, has denied in his Senate testimony any problem with alcohol or any conflicts of interest concerning his business ties.</s>

<s docid="AP890211-0110" num="18" wdcount="47"> In the divorce deposition, Tower said he went to work for British Aerospace eight weeks after resigning as the nation's chief strategic arms negotiator and advised the company on how to sell training jets, fighter planes and missile systems to the Pentagon, the Los Angeles Times reported.</s>
<s docid="AP890211-0110" num="19" wdcount="26"> Tower told the Senate committee he worked chiefly on selling commercial aircraft to U.S. airlines and also advised the firm on trade legislation and currency fluctuations.</s>

<s docid="AP890211-0110" num="22" wdcount="26"> The deposition was never filed in court because Tower did not contest the divorce, but a copy was obtained by the FBI, the Legal Times said.</s>

<s docid="AP890228-0146" num="12" wdcount="33"> The newspaper reported that Combest later gave a different story to the FBI, saying that Tower and a group of friends _ not Tower alone _ had frequently consumed a bottle of scotch.</s>

<s docid="AP890316-0012" num="24" wdcount="29"> He insisted that Tower was the best man for the job and he spoke out repeatedly for his choice, even after it was clear that the nomination was doomed.</s>
<s docid="AP890316-0012" num="25" wdcount="16"> But he didn't get nasty about it, saying there was no point in escalating the fight.</s>

<s docid="AP890316-0012" num="29" wdcount="27"> The 53-47 vote against Tower was a setback to Bush in the sense that it always is a defeat when Congress denies a president something he wants.</s>

<s docid="AP890316-0012" num="31" wdcount="24"> Indeed, it could turn out that the Senate did the president a favor by sending Tower back to Texas instead of to the Pentagon.</s>
<s docid="AP890316-0012" num="32" wdcount="25"> It was a break Bush could not make with a political ally who had been after the Pentagon job since Ronald Reagan was elected president.</s>

<s docid="AP890316-0012" num="35" wdcount="29"> After Tower's long wait, Bush displayed his own loyalty, all the way to a losing vote when the standard, somewhat safer course would have been to withdraw the nominee.</s>
<s docid="AP890316-0012" num="36" wdcount="23"> Tower not only shunned withdrawal; he offered conditions that had to be humiliating, if only the Senate would let him have the job.</s>
<s docid="AP890316-0012" num="37" wdcount="11"> Tower promised to quit drinking, taking the pledge on national television.</s>

<s docid="AP890316-0012" num="39" wdcount="30"> Republicans proposed that he get the job for a six-month trial and then return for reconfirmation, a gimmick that would have changed the system and could have haunted the presidency.</s>
<s docid="AP890316-0012" num="40" wdcount="2"> No deal.</s>
<s docid="AP890316-0012" num="41" wdcount="18"> So Tower became the ninth Cabinet nominee ever to be rejected, the first who was a former senator.</s>
